Day, and Mohammad Mirhosseini\nThe kinetic inductance of charge carriers in disordered superconductors provides a broadband low-loss source of nonlinear electromagnetic response. This work investigates TiN nanowires as an alternative to Josephson junctions for applications involving elevated temperatures, higher frequencies, and strong magnetic fields. An extreme nanowire geometry for TiN microwave resonators leads to current-density concentration and enhanced self-Kerr coefficient, yielding a nonlinearity-to-loss ratio as high as 21% and quality factor exceeding 10,000. Such devices may find application in quantum frequency conversion of microwave photons, and with improvement might attain strong quantum nonlinearity.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

The classical Landau-Lifshitz spin dynamics may be generalized to model the coupled dynamics of dipoles, quadrupoles, and higher order multipoles. This paper introduces temperature-dependent Langevin noise and damping terms to the generalized spin dynamics. High numerical efficiency is possible by working with coherent states in the Schrödinger picture. The method is illustrated via simulation of magnetic skyrmion dynamics both in and out of equilibrium.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 106, 235154] Published Tue Dec 27, 2022",

The authors use their recently developed extension of photoelasticity for coupled fluid-granular systems to image particle stresses during fracture by air injection in an oil-saturated granular pack. They discover two states of the granular medium evolving with the fractures, plus an “effective-stress shadow” behind the propagating fracture tips.

In this work, the authors use a specific electron spin resonance technique, based on photoconductivity measurements using graphene-based terahertz detectors, to probe zero-field splittings of graphene as a function of temperature. They demonstrate experimentally that the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and the staggered sublattice potential, which reduces the topological gap, are both temperature dependent.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

To try to learn how magnetism develops in ultrathin systems, we measure, but deducing the physics afterward is an ill-posed problem. This study uses neural networks to facilitate the reconstruction of the underlying magnetic textures of thin magnets through measurements of their stray fields. The technique is surprisingly robust to experimental noise, and can reliably reconstruct magnetism in arbitrary directions. Importantly, prior training of the network is not required, and the technique is broadly applicable for solving ill-posed inverse problems when the forward problem is well defined.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Such rearrangement implies a potential for unprecedented domain wall speeds. Ultrafast distortions in diffraction features via magnetic small angle x-ray scattering have been seen in some studies, while they have been absent in others. Here, the controversy is resolved by measuring a sample with domain-pattern symmetry varying from labyrinths to stripes. Importantly, spatial rearrangement occurs with labyrinths but not with stripes, suggesting novel and unexpected physics yet to be understood.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

In undoped cuprates, where the signal is large, we expect phonons contribute significantly to the effect. While there is no obvious universal mechanism whereby phonons break time-reversal symmetry and acquire chirality, this paper provides a general treatment of the phonon Hall effect from the inelastic scattering of phonons off of other excitations in quantum materials. As an application, magnetoelastic coupling in square-lattice Néel antiferromagnets is investigated thoroughly using the formalism developed in the first part of the paper.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

This fluid state, called layered convection, has been proposed to occur in giant planets. However, it is not guaranteed that secondary convective layers can form and survive underneath a turbulent convection zone. Our simulations find that below an evolving convection zone, layer formation is difficult and the fluid always fully mixes.

Here, the authors construct analytically solvable models to study the effects of long-range coupling on such measurement-induced phases, and also provide a minimal theoretical understanding of the phases and the phase transition in both spin and fermionic models. They show that power law couplings and measurements result in a rich entanglement phase diagram, including robust dynamical quantum phases with good error correcting properties, namely a power-law code distance.\n\n[Phys.

The authors studied FeSe/STO thin films with x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), and atomic multiplet simulation. The work clarifies that FeSe thin films (1UC to 10UC) are shown with pure low-spin 3d6 electronic occupancy. Besides, the 3d6 state in 1UC FeSe/STO is more robust under oxidization. This study calls for a high-resolution RIXS exploration of the pristine 1UC FeSe/STO thin film to reveal the many-body excitations.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 106, 245112] Published Fri Dec 09, 2022",

Here, it is demonstrated that a resonant excitation of nutation can switch the orientation of the magnetic moments within picoseconds. 90° and 180° switching can be realized in both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, surpassing the switching speed achievable by any procedure based on spin precession.\n\n[Phys.

The method satisfies certain conservation laws and thermodynamic consistency, and the self-consistent framework allows us to systematically include strong correlations. Fully self-consistent GW calculations of real materials have so far been hampered by their high computational cost. This paper presents algorithmic improvements and implementation details for the fully self-consistent GW method that make such calculations routinely possible and documents the performance of the method via examples from several materials.\n\n[Phys.

Kozák\nTransition metal dichalcogenide monolayers possess two nonequivalent valleys in the extrema of their band structure. It turns out that off-resonant circularly polarized light affects the electronic excitations in each valley dissimilarly. Such a phenomenon leads to different shifts of the excitonic transitions in nonequivalent valleys of the monolayer. Here, the authors report on a theoretical investigation of such valley-selective transient shifts of both 1sA and 1sB exciton transitions in MoS2 and WSe2 monolayers. The study is based on the semiconductor Bloch equations, where, contrary to the previous studies, the many-body Coulomb interaction effects are properly included. The theoretical estimates of the excitonic shifts are in a good agreement with these novel experimental results.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 106, 235304] Published Mon Dec 05, 2022",

Minnich\nThe scattering of electrons by phonons in semiconductors has been assumed to be dominated by the lowest-order process involving a single phonon. Using a new numerical approach to incorporate the next-leading-order process involving two phonons into high-field transport calculations from first principles, the authors find here that the two-phonon process contributes nearly as much as the single-phonon process to high-field transport phenomena. This finding resolves a long-standing discrepancy regarding the strength of intervalley scattering in GaAs as determined from different experimental methods.\n\n[Phys. Rev.
