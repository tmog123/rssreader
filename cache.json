In this study, the authors present novel vanadium-based kagome antimonides that incorporate the chemical flexibility of a rare-earth site, allowing for the intertwining of magnetic and charge degrees of freedom. These new compounds, namely EuV3Sb4 and YbV3Sb4, provide valuable insights into the relatively small LnM3X4 family and open up potential avenues for the realization of additional rare-earth, antimonide-based kagome metals.\n\n[Phys.

However, when we calculate it using structures that are dynamically unstable, results in artificially reduced values and lack of convergence with cell size. By comparing the calculated values with experimental data, the authors can clearly see the importance of using dynamically stable structures for accurate calculations. This comparison also validates the reliability of density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, using a high-throughput approach, the authors perform such calculations to identify new candidates for solar thermochemical hydrogen production among ABO3 perovskite materials, demonstrating the striong influence of B-site cations on the oxygen vacancy formation energy.\n\n[Phys.

Aydil\nYtterbium-doped CsPbCl3 emerges as the primary contender for a quantum cutting coating on silicon solar cells, aiming to enhance both their efficiencies and durability. This is accomplished by converting each incident ultraviolet and blue photon with energies greater than 2.5 eV into two 1.25 eV near-infrared red photons. The potential of this approach lies in the possibility of surpassing the Quessier limit, thereby augmenting the efficiencies of silicon solar cells. While thin films produced through colloidal synthesis and nanocrystal dispersions have demonstrated photoluminescence quantum yields nearing 200%, there has been a growing interest in employing physical vapor deposition as a large-area scalable method due to sub-band gap absorption exhibited by colloidal films. In the present study, the authors made an intriguing discovery regarding the significant influence of post-deposition annealing environment and protocols on the near-infrared photoluminescence quantum yields in Yb-doped halide perovskite films that demonstrate the downconversion of ultraviolet and blue light through quantum cutting.\n\n[Phys.

The study of their dynamics in solids has often been performed using homogeneous order parameter theories. By microscopically modeling the photoinduced melting and recovery of a charge density wave, the authors instead show here that the transient dynamics can lead to disordered state, where the average order parameter is not representative of the atomic-scale configuration. This provides a possible minimal model description of the experimentally proposed inhomogeneous disordering pathway in photoinduced phase transitions.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

This flow configuration is of interest in aeroacoustics and aeronautics, as it mimics the effect of forward flight in real aircraft. We perform a thorough characterization of the effect of the flight stream, combining experimental and numerical data, signal processing, and linear modeling. We show that the flight stream reduces fluctuation energy in a broad region of the frequency-wavenumber space and stabilizes flow structures underpinned by modal and non-modal instability mechanisms. Streaky structures, associated with helical azimuthal wavenumbers and very slow timescales, are the most strongly affected by the flight stream.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

At very low energies, even the pions can be integrated out, providing a simple yet thorough framework to study nuclear physics with controlled theoretical uncertainties. This work extends previous studies to A≤4 with accurate predictions for low-energy few-nucleon scattering, comparable to those from the best current analyses.

Here, the authors study charge tunable devices based on WSe2 and WS2 monolayers. In addition to the well-known radiative recombination of neutral and charged excitons, photoluminescence measurements highlight a weaker intensity optical transition. This line is interpreted as an impurity-assisted recombination of the negatively charged exciton (triplet trion), whose radiative recombination energy differs by ∆c from that of the trion’s direct optically active recombination.\n\n[Phys.

Katsnelson, Mark van Schilfgaarde, Malte Rösner, and Philip Hofmann\nUnderstanding the electronic structure of the layered magnetic semiconductor CrSBr is a formidable challenge for both experiment and theory. The material is highly insulating at low temperatures, preventing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy investigations in the magnetically ordered phase. Theoretically, not only the non-local Coulomb interaction in the low-dimensional compound needs to be addressed properly, but a comparison to the experimental data also requires an approximate handling of the paramagnetic phase. Including these effects gives an excellent understanding of the experimentally observed band structure.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 107, 235107] Published Fri Jun 02, 2023",

The approach combines machine learning with traditional fitting, to take advantage of the desirable properties of each. Also, analysis of cross capacitance may be used for automatic identification of the spurious QDs that occasionally form during device tuning. These techniques can autonomously flag devices with spurious dots near the operating regime, which is crucial information for reliable tuning for qubit operations.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Probing the transient crystal structure directly by femtosecond x-ray diffraction reveals oscillations of diffracted intensity at a frequency of 2.6 THz, which persist on a picosecond time scale. They reflect coherent wave packet motions along back-folded phonon coordinates in the crystal of reduced symmetry.

We show theoretically and experimentally that when the bubble is attached to the tube, its growth can be monotonic and progressive or go through an unstable state of rapid growth. Our analytical model, which reproduces experimental data, uses a dimensionless number B combining the container volume, tube radius, and Laplace and atmospheric pressures. The pressure dependence suggests that the gas compressibility, which induces a nonzero hydrodynamic compliance, is at the origin of the instability and explains the great bubble size disparity of bubbles produced by blowing at an imposed gas flow rate.\n\n[Phys.

Fiorillo, Gustavo Marques-Tavares, and Edoardo Vitagliano\nThis study revisits bounds on axion-like particles (ALPs) derived from supernovae, where they may be generated in stellar interiors before decaying to photons. Past works have used observations from SN1987A to exclude ALP masses of 10s of MeV, due to the absence of a signal in the Gamma Ray Spectrometer aboard the Solar Maximum Mission satellite. The present paper argues that such particles would generate a fireball of plasma around the supernova, ultimately leading to a much lower energy photon signal, thus invalidating the old bounds in this scenario. However, the authors find that data from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter can be used to set similar limits.\n\n[Phys. Rev. D 107, 103029] Published Thu May 18, 2023",

Center of mass conservation is shown to dramatically alter the nature of the quantum phase diagram, which hosts several types of unusual gapless phases. These results hint at a wealth of interesting phenomena waiting to be uncovered in the physics of kinetically constrained many-body systems.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 107, 195132] Published Tue May 16, 2023",

The present work provides theoretical calculations on several competing candidate effects that can account for it. The third-order contribution known as the jerk current matches the measured magnitude of the photocurrent as well as its angular distribution. The origin of the large photoresponse is traced back to a constructive interference between the effective mass and the dipole matrix element of the Weyl bands crossing the Fermi level.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

This work points out a vulnerability of LN devices of which manufacturers and users must become aware, so that appropriate countermeasures may be implemented.

For Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells, antisite defects have long been considered the main recombination centers, yet the underlying mechanism has remained elusive. Here first-principles calculations show that these “killer centers” themselves cannot capture holes efficiently for effective recombination. However, internal conversion to the distorted neutral DX center does open an efficient hole-capture pathway, and DX’s stability in CIGS increases with Ga concentration, which resolves the longstanding issue of why the efficiency of CIGS solar cells decreases at high Ga concentration.\n\n[Phys.

Through multiple state-of-the-art microscopy techniques the authors visualize Ag+ migration in AgBiP2Se6, and how it modulates the interfacial barrier to induce switchable diodelike transport in a device. Illuminating the device can be used to switch off its ionic tunability, expanding its functionality.
