Here, the authors synthesize an LK-99 sample and find a multiphase, transparent material that does not support high-temperature superconductivity. This is in agreement with ab initio calculations here that suggest the copper dopant does not meaningfully enter the structure and that the flat bands they generate at the Fermi level are largely unhybridized, with no quantum geometry to support a superfluid state.\n\n[Phys.

Probably not: The intensity of that reflected sound is negligible, compared to the other reflections in your office…and what if we put out more mugs? Acoustic cloning, a form of holography, allows us to study acoustic wave propagation and reflection from a physical scatterer, even with modifications to that object. This study presents both theoretical framework and experimental implementation. The method is expected to be widely applicable in all domains of acoustic scattering, such as material characterization, active metamaterials, and virtual-acoustics applications.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

This led us to investigate the vortex dynamics and lift generation as a corrugated wing transitions from a stationary state to translational motion. The results reveal that suppression of secondary vortices generated on the wing significantly improves the overall performance of corrugated wings. This advances our understanding of flight dynamics and can also contribute to applications in engineering and biomimicry.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Fluids 8, 123101] Published Thu Dec 07, 2023",

Here, the authors observe magnetic-field periodic oscillations in a graphite thin film under magnetic fields where only two Landau levels remain. At this quasiquantum limit, they propose a new quantum oscillation mechanism: the quantum Sondheimer effect. The oscillations arise from the formation of the resonant modes periodically appearing in the magnetic fields.

Here the spatial resolution is constrained solely by the field range of the Ic(H) pattern and is unrelated to the junction’s size.

Yet, it is standard for first-principles exciton calculations to sample the entire Brillouin zone uniformly, at great computational cost and resulting in underconverged exciton binding energies. Here, the authors demonstrate that a straightforward-to-implement nonuniform sampling approach yields highly converged exciton binding energies, which can significantly differ from previous best theoretical estimates, at a fraction of the computational expense of uniform sampling approaches. This will enable the prediction of exciton binding energies of increasingly complex materials.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 235117] Published Mon Dec 04, 2023",

Here, we examine a previously neglected aspect of the problem: The compressibility of the injected gas. We use experiments, numerical simulations, and an axisymmetric model to show that gas compression controls the time-dependent injection rate and systematically delays the onset of viscous fingering at high capillary number. We quantify the importance of gas compression with a single dimensionless compressibility number.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Fluids 8, 113904] Published Wed Nov 29, 2023",

The authors use the single spin of a nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) center in diamond to probe nanoscale magnetic fields in the GHz regime, identifying signatures of a free-running and phase-locked spin-torque oscillator in the fluorescence spectrum of a proximal N-V, and measure how the dynamics impact the N-V’s spin relaxation.

They can be better studied by using propagating-spin-wave spectroscopy with a physically transparent model. This study of spin-wave transduction focuses on the interaction between spin waves and microwaves, and the impact of the spin-wave dispersion relation. The authors choose specific magnetization orientations so that the magnons and microwave photons do not couple, and show that line-shaped dispersion relations can be harnessed to engineer reconfigurable, nonreciprocal frequency filters transferring spin wave energy in a unidirectional manner.\n\n[Phys.

The magnetometers used to detect the expected magnetic field patterns are placed in areas in which magnetic noise sources, such as anthropogenic ones, are minimal. Although no conclusive detection is reported, limits are set for models in various parameter ranges and the prospects for refining the detection methodology are presented.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

In fact, measurements of the antineutrino flux from reactors have shown a deficit with respect to predictions, which has become known as the reactor antineutrino anomaly. This work combines a careful analysis of up-to-date nuclear decay data with advanced theoretical corrections to the V-A theory of β decay to produce, for the first time, a flux prediction with a comprehensive uncertainty budget. This new prediction achieves a better agreement with existing experimental neutrino data and methodically pins down points for improvements. It will likely stimulate targeted research to check and improve the experimental inputs, with potentially wide-ranging impact, from weak-interaction physics to many aspects of nuclear reactor science and technology.\n\n[Phys.

          "description": "Author(s): Alessandro Pitanti, Mingyun Yuan, Simone Zanotto, and Paulo Ventura Santos\nManipulating mechanical waves at gigahertz frequencies can lead to next-generation communication technologies, but designing wave-controlling devices requires high-resolution and fast-scanning mapping of acoustic fields. The authors introduce the use of acoustic atomic force microscopy to characterize phononic crystals at gigahertz frequency, showing mechanical vibration mapping with tens-of-nanometer resolution and symmetry-dependent scattering. This study sets the baseline for advanced operations like hyperspectral filtering, beam steering, or spatial-division multiplexing, and will have an impact on the development of acoustic-based microwave technologies.\n\n[Phys.

A pressing challenge is to unravel the intriguing pairing mechanism within these materials. Here, the authors point out a novel role of Hund’s rule to transmit the superexchange coupling of the dz2 orbital to the dx2−y2 orbital, which is a key factor for understanding the remarkably high Tc. The transmitted Hund coupling makes the dx2−y2 orbital feel a large interlayer spin coupling but no interlayer hopping, a situation not explored before. Within one-orbital mean-field theory, the authors find robust s-wave pairing even at 50% hole doping. Moreover, they propose a new analytical framework, the so-called type-II t-J model, which they argue is the minimal model to incorporate all essential ingredients, including large Hund’s coupling and two orbital effects. This work offers a new model, develops a pioneering method, and identifies intriguing pairing mechanisms in the emerging nickelate field.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 174511] Published Tue Nov 21, 2023",

Parker\nFractional Chern insulators exhibit the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) in crystalline systems, without the need for strong magnetic fields, resulting in charge fractionalization, long-range entanglement, and anyonic statistics, potentially at elevated energy scales. The lowest Landau level (LLL) hosts the FQHE, but high Landau levels and many Chern bands do not. Vortexable bands capture the essential physics of the LLL that leads to the FQHE without requiring its more fine-tuned properties, such as uniformity of Berry curvature and of charge density.\n\n[Phys.

A fundamental assumption of MOST is that velocity near the surface does not follow a logarithmic profile due to buoyancy effects driven by stratification. In contrast to MOST, we find that buoyancy does not change the logarithmic nature of velocity profiles but instead modifies the slope of the log law. The proposed logarithmic profile can serve as an alternative to MOST, possibly leading to more realistic predictions of weather and climate, especially in polar regions.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Here, the authors obtain strong Josephson tunneling in 45∘-twisted cuprates with ultrahigh interfacial quality and precisely calibrated twist angles. The results firmly establish the existence of isotropic pairing in twisted cuprates, posing strong constraints on the theory considering a pure d wave or d+id wave. They also extend the study to the overdoped regime and observe the Josephson diode effect, promising next-generation high-temperature superconducting devices.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Umar\nHeavy-ion fusion is a major research area, and practical approaches to describe the evolution of the nucleon movement across the barrier between the two nuclei are highly relevant for elucidating the essential dynamics of the fusion process. When two nuclei approach each other to distances where the nuclear force becomes active, neutrons and protons could move from one nucleus to the other. This movement could open and facilitate the pathway to fusion. The authors employ a microscopic many-body approach based on the density-constrained time-dependent Hartree-Fock calculations to study the impact of isospin (i.e., proton versus neutron) dynamics on low-energy nuclear fusion along an isotope chain and its dependence on the deformation of the colliding nuclei. In asymmetric systems, iso-vector dynamics plays a significant role. Its typical effect is a reduction in the potential barrier, which turns into enhancement for neutron-rich systems. These effects could be studied at facilities that provide beams of exotic, unstable nuclei.\n\n[Phys. Rev. C 108, L051602] Published Tue Nov 14, 2023",
