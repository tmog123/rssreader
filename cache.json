(ATLAS Collaboration)\nWhen two nuclei collide at relativistic energies, the collisions between nucleons create back-to-back streams (jets) of particles. These jets traverse the hot and dense strongly interacting medium produced in these collisions. The ATLAS Collaboration measured the differential yields of dijets as a function of the dijet momentum balance for selections on collisional geometry in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. They quantified the centrality dependence of dijet suppression and studied the suppression of the leading and sub-leading jets constituting the dijet. These results provide important information on dijet suppression and provide new insights into the path-length dependence on jet medium interactions.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Chubukov, and Leonid Levitov\nThe recently discovered superconductivity in Bernal bilayer graphene features unique behavior that distinguishes it from conventional superconductors. Firstly, the onset of superconductivity is associated with the emergence of an isospin-polarized phase, driven by Stoner instability. Secondly, the superconductivity is activated by a magnetic field and persists beyond the Pauli limit. These properties have sparked the interest of researchers and prompted the search for a pairing mechanism that can account for these findings. This paper reports on recent progress in this quest.​\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 107, 174512] Published Thu May 11, 2023",

Here, via the implementation of a high-resolution spectroscopy technique, the authors highlight the peculiarities of collective excitations of a polariton superfluid and reveal a wealth of phenomena intrinsically linked to the light-matter and driven-dissipative nature of their system, such as the observation of a ghost branch highlighted in red in the image.\n\n[Phys.

Close to the Anderson transition, electronic wave functions show a peculiar multifractal structure, predicted to enhance Cooper pairing. Here, the authors probe the weak disorder limit using an atomic monolayer of lead with high-resolution scanning tunneling spectroscopy. They show that mesoscopic spatial fluctuations of the electronic density of states indicate coherent diffusion of electrons. They use these energy-dependent fluctuations to reveal tiny energy gap fluctuations and to extract the elastic mean free path, dephasing length, as theoretically expected.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

So far, readout capabilities and device coherence have been limited by lossy III−V substrates, but here researchers overcome this limitation with a flip-chip approach to microwave experiments on ABSs. Superconductor-semiconductor devices and microwave resonators are placed on different chips and inductively coupled via a vacuum gap, enabling high-quality readout without sacrificing device properties.\n\n[Phys.

Using the AMI equation, the effect of edge Mach number (Ma) and wall-cooling are measured on the turbulent torque that enhances the skin friction coefficient. Moreover, the AMI equation introduces stress-weighted density that yields a more robust collapse of the dataset with different configurations. The MTEI equation distinguishes the impact of Ma and wall-cooling on the turbulent flux of mean kinetic energy and enthalpy, respectively.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

(ATLAS Collaboration\n)\nIn ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions the Lorentz-contracted electromagnetic fields of the nuclei are a source of high-energy quasireal photons which can produce muon pairs via the process γ+γ→μ++μ−. In hadronic Pb+Pb collisions the two leptons in the final state provide a sensitive probe of the quark-gluon plasma created in the Pb+Pb collision or the strong magnetic fields that the plasma generates. This work presents new measurements by the ATLAS collaboration at the LHC of the Pb+Pb collision centrality dependence of the angular decorrelation of muon pairs created via the γγ process. Comparisons of the results to theoretical calculations suggest that the observed decorrelation in more central collisions results from an initial-state broadening of the photon transverse momenta and not from the interaction of the muons with the plasma or its magnetic field.\n\n[Phys.

In this interference technique, performance can be very sensitive to both sample transmission and losses. This study shows that by balancing the nonlinear interferometer’s arms, one can completely recover fringe visibility caused by signal loss. Moreover, intentional unbalancing offers a reduced-interaction regime where the detected power can be 200 times higher than the power reaching the sample, for ultrasensitive midinfrared sensing well below the conventional noise floor.\n\n[Phys.

The intensity begins to saturate at lower temperatures, coinciding with a change of the magnetic structure.

The hydrodynamic interactions among bubbles in a chain determine its stability. The wake behind each bubble affects the subsequent ones, producing a lift force. For a clean and small bubble, the lift force is destabilizing; when surfactants are present or the bubble size exceeds a certain value, the additional vorticity production on the surface changes the structure of the wake and the sign of the lift force is reversed resulting in a stable chain.\n\n[Phys.

Thus little is known about nonequilibrium ODOS properties, although they are important in e.g. solar cells and LEDs. This work presents an optical technique for monitoring the ODOS distribution of relaxed charge carriers at low temperatures. The distribution that forms under nonequilibrium conditions is always narrower than that of the full DOS, in a universal ratio of about 2/3 that is reproduced by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations assuming spatially correlated disorder.\n\n[Phys.

They find a high-energy spectrum consistent with reports of a spinon Fermi surface state in triangular lattice compounds, although the low-energy spectrum rules out such a phase, and points towards a U(1) Dirac spin liquid.

Vandersypen\nFrequency multiplexing of operations is an attractive strategy to control multiple qubits simultaneously in a spin-based quantum processor with relatively few control lines. However, high-fidelity operation demands good spectral addressability and noncontextual spin dynamics. The authors explore an unexpected crosstalk mechanism, in which the Rabi frequency of one spin changes markedly depending on the simultaneous operation of another. They also connect this behavior to another surprising feature: the nonlinear scaling of Rabi frequency with resonant driving amplitude. These results provide insight into the challenges that such state-of-the-art control methods will face.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 19, 044078] Published Tue Apr 25, 2023",

In principle, a single photon can carry much information in its spatiotemporal modes; the challenge is to read it out, as linear optical elements are not sensitive to the subtle differences among those modes. This study demonstrates a nonlinear-optical approach in which a single pass through a LiNiO3 waveguide can separate photons according to their detailed spatiotemporal profiles or their superpositions, even if they completely overlap with each other. This provides access to photons’ large Hilbert spaces, pointing to applications in free-space quantum communication, computing, and sensing.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

The authors demonstrate that embedded Rydberg atoms can be used for noninvasive, near-real-time measurement of the electric fields between ions in CABIS, and thereby to control Coulomb-induced degradation via feedback. The spectra of different Rydberg states reveal which states are suitable for low- and high-field monitoring, and this work also sheds light on many-body interactions between ultracold ions and neutral atoms.\n\n[Phys.

In nuclear density functional theory (DFT), the description of fissioning systems with an odd number of particles is markedly more involved, both formally and computationally. This article combines coupled-channels reaction theory, which provides the spin distribution of the fissioning system, and nuclear DFT, which describes the collective dynamics of fission, to predict the charge and mass distribution of fission fragments of odd-mass uranium isotopes. The new methodology offers a path forward to properly account for the entrance channel in the description of fission observables.\n\n[Phys. Rev. C 107, 044312] Published Mon Apr 17, 2023",

By introducing an innovative oscillator-based sensor architecture, and employing a ferrimagnetic material rather than the paramagnetic spin defects more commonly studied, this work details the construction of a compact magnetometer with a minimum sensitivity of 100 fT/√Hz. The sensor’s architecture offers advantages in dynamic range, simplicity, and compactness—qualities that may enable widespread use of solid-state quantum sensors outside a laboratory environment.\n\n[Phys.

They fit the model to a large database of density functional theory calculations of elemental and binary materials from sixty-four main group and transition metal atoms, using an active learning procedure to generate and test out-of-sample structures.

A vortex ring of various strengths is made to interact with oil-impregnated porous surfaces with the aim of understanding the mechanism of oil ejection from the porous surface. The vortex dynamics involves different phenomena like vortex cancellation and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The cleaning takes place from both sides of the porous surface through an intricate interaction process characterized by Rayleigh-Taylor and Rayleigh-Plateau type instabilities that is studied in three different regimes: i) Penetration, ii) Bag formation, and iii) Bag breakup.\n\n[Phys.
