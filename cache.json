The authors combined inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering measurements to study this structural transition. They determined the low-energy phonon dispersions and detected the relevant phonon branch becoming soft. While theoretical calculations broadly agree with the measured dispersion, a clear non-mean-field behavior is demonstrated at this phase transition, which might be connected with quantum criticality and the superconducting dome.\n\n[Phys.

But what kinds of quantum states are efficiently represented by neural networks? To approach this problem, the authors study here entanglement properties of an ensemble of neural network states represented by random restricted Boltzmann machines. Phases with distinct entanglement features are identified and characterized. In particular, the authors show that these neural network states can look typical in their entanglement profile while still being distinguishable from a typical state by their fractal dimensions.\n\n[Phys.

Here, the authors present a new member TbV6Sn6, which contains a pure vanadium kagome lattice. Thermodynamic, magnetometric, and transport measurements reveal an Ising ferromagnetism of local Tb 4f moments accompanied by an anomalous Hall effect below 4.1 K. The Tb magnetism displays a strikingly large uniaxial anisotropy, which the authors argue originates from 4f crystalline electric field effects in a hexagonal symmetry environment.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

This study introduces weakly tunable qubits, whose frequency can be tuned over a small range via external magnetic flux. Through theoretical derivation and experimental demonstration, the authors show that these transmonlike qubits—without losing the desired key properties—can be used to avoid frequency collisions in large qubit systems while minimizing the sensitivity to flux noise. They can also be applied to operate flux-tuned qubit gates.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 18, 034057] Published Thu Sep 22, 2022",

Mizuochi\nQuantum sensing of low-frequency fields is important for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) due to its rich structure and narrow line widths, both at low fields focusing on J couplings and at high fields for down-converted frequencies from conventional NMR. However, the most sensitive and coherent quantum sensing methods work at dc and high-frequency fields only. This study utilizes a quantum oscilloscope approach to bridge this gap. The resulting algorithm has a frequency-independent sensitivity and is able to work in the zero-field region. This approach would have an impact on designing low-frequency measurements where the high sensitivities of quantum sensors are an indispensable treat.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

This saves a considerable amount of computing time over relativistic Hartree-Fock calculations with nonlocal potentials. The PCF-PK1 is obtained by fitting nuclear matter and finite nuclei, including the results of ab-initio calculations; it eliminates spurious shell closures at Z=58 and 92; and it accurately reproduces Gamow-Teller resonances in closed-shell nuclei. This new covariant density functional PCF-PK1 with exchange correlation is expected to provide a unified and consistent description for both nuclear ground states and excited states, in particular for unstable nuclei far from stability.\n\n[Phys.

Adding a Λ hyperon, a sibling of the nucleon with a strange quark, to light nuclei promises new insights as its isospin impurity must impact CSB in mirror hypernuclei, where the only good data available are for A=4. The authors use an ansatz that relates the charge-symmetry-breaking ΛN interaction to the ΛN↔ΣN strong-interaction coupling via the small isospin-one admixture the Λ obtains from the Σ0, as both are members of an SU(3) baryon octet and have an u-d-s quark structure. Once the large CSB observed in mirror hypernuclei Λ4H and Λ4He is reproduced, the deduced isospin-one admixture of the Λ when inside these hypernuclei matches that in free space, provided SU(3) symmetry is partially conserved for these baryons. This approach can be tested in heavier hypernuclei when precise data for CSB become available.\n\n[Phys. Rev. C 106, L031001] Published Tue Sep 20, 2022",

In contrast to 3d-electron vdW magnets, very few f-electron vdW magnets have been studied. Here, the authors report the physical properties of Ce2Te5 single crystals, a layered 4f-electron vdW magnet. Four consecutive (magnetic) phase transitions at ∼ 5.2, 2.1, 0.9, and 0.4 K are observed, suggesting competing antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic exchange interactions.

This work addresses the concepts of many-body and one-body self-interaction, which are found to be connected through the dielectric constant within a unified theoretical formulation. The superiority of the many-body self-interaction is demonstrated, resulting in robust polaron formation energies. In this context, an efficient semilocal scheme for polaron localization is developed.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 106, 125119] Published Wed Sep 14, 2022",

Tensor network methods have entered the arena as a highly competitive, versatile, and well-controlled approach. Here, in particular, the authors use a recently developed hybrid renormalization group thermofield quench approach. With this, they obtain reliable predictions for spintronic transport through a Kondo-correlated quantum dot coupled to magnetic leads in far-from-equilibrium conditions. The work focuses on the effects of the induced exchange field. As a key result, they demonstrate that an additional external magnetic field can be utilized to achieve a full Kondo revival in an out-of-equilibrium setting.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Here a multinational team presents a specialized microscope to better understand the inner workings of such silicon chips, by scanning a finely focused beam of ultralow-energy ions across the surface. The tiny “click” that each ion makes when it hits the chip is detected and mapped, enabling the identification of manufacturing defects; these results can then be fed back to improve the fabrication process.\n\n[Phys.

A key challenge is to be able to predict a priori the amplitude of the tsunami wave that would be engendered by a given cliff collapse. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive model of shallow water waves generated by the subaerial collapse of a granular column. The proposed model is able to capture the role of the geometry of the collapse as well as the water depth and is successfully compared to a large dataset of experiments.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

In circuit quantum electrodynamics, a leading quantum computer architecture, qubit readout is commonly one of the longest and lowest-fidelity processes. The authors numerically explore the dynamics of a driven transmon-resonator system under strong, nearly resonant measurement drives to better understand this issue. They find clear signs of transmon “ionization”, in which the qubit escapes its confining potential under the influence of the drive, and semiclassical methods then reveal the mechanism. This approach can be used to optimize circuit parameters, suppress these spurious effects, and increase readout fidelity.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 18, 034031] Published Tue Sep 13, 2022",

Microscopic theoretical approaches are difficult to control, and there has been no single decisive experiment able to completely fix the pairing symmetry. In spite of this, this work shows that by carefully drawing on information from a diverse array of existing experiments – and using some minimal and general input from theory – the nature of the pairing can be almost uniquely determined.\n\n[Phys.

It is shown that the transition process which is initiated by the amplification of perturbations in a separated shear layer downstream of the trip wire is accelerated by the injection of polymer leading to an earlier breakdown to turbulence. However, significant levels of polymer induced drag reduction are noted in the mid-to-late transitioning regions highlighting a critical shear stress based onset criteria for activation of drag reduction.\n\n[Phys.

Here, the authors return to the classic example of Cu2OSeO3 to tackle a remaining issue: external magnetic field dependence of higher-order modulations. Performing long-exposure small-angle-neutron scattering, a clear difference was observed for the field dependence of the (1 1 0) and (2 0 0) modulations. Comparison to numerical Monte Carlo simulations suggest the appearance of weak swirling spin structures depending on the strength of the external magnetic field.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

So far, spectral coverage of IRQAS systems has been limited to less than 1 µm. This work reports a wavelength-tunable IRQAS system and an efficient measurement scheme to achieve broadband spectroscopy in a short acquisition time. The successful demonstration of rapid spectral measurement over a wide midinfrared window (1.9–5.2 µm) exhibits the great potential of this technique and paves the way for the use of IRQAS in real-world applications.\n\n[Phys.

Julien\nSpin-stripe order is a property of the high-Tc cuprate La2−xSrxCuO4 that is observed for x ≤ 0.13 but not at larger doping because it is nullified by superconducting order. However, it can be restored by applying intense magnetic fields that erase superconductivity. The present analysis of NMR data sheds light on how glasslike freezing of spin stripes emerges from the field-induced vortex cores and how such field-induced magnetism matters for the interpretation of any experiment below the pseudogap boundary at x = 0.19.\n\n[Phys.

This paper reports the discovery of a topological spin memory effect, which provides a promising new avenue for information encryption and recovery. The authors demonstrate experimentally that antiferromagnetically (AFM)-coupled bubble skyrmion pairs stabilized in a Co/Gd/Pt multilayered film at room temperature evolve into complex in-plane spin textures as the temperature is lowered and then reform completely when warmed back up. Simulations show that Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions play a key role in this spin memory effect and reveal that the topological charge is preserved throughout the spin reorientation transition and recovery.\n\n[Phys.

Layered transition metal dichalcogenides such as bulk 1T-TaSe2 offer a unique platform for accomplishing this since the electrons in each charge density wave (CDW) unit cell are susceptible to both Coulomb repulsion and interlayer coupling. By using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, the authors identify here a multitude of correlated surface states that exist on bulk 1T-TaSe2 with properties ranging all the way from Mott insulating to strongly metallic Kondo behavior. 1T-TaSe2 thus simulates the full range of the periodic Anderson model within a single crystal by combining electron correlations with variable interlayer coupling.\n\n[Phys.

Using a 3D microscopic model, the authors demonstrate here that disorder in the film is both essential for inducing robust superconductivity and potentially detrimental, as it generates “induced disorder”.

          "description": "Author(s): Shuaifeng Li, Liza M. Roger, Judith Klein-Seetharaman, Nastassja A. Lewinski, and Jinkyu Yang\nHuman activities threaten coral survival. A better understanding of the coral behaviors in response to environmental changes may lead to a rescue plan but remains challenging. The authors demonstrate quantitative features of coral motion—a key trait of coral polyps—through real-time microscopy on a fluidic platform, and discover the correlated fractional Brownian motion of coral polyps under different light and temperature conditions. Numerical analysis and theoretical modeling are performed to interpret the observed coral dynamics. This work provides systematic techniques to study coral polyp motions and advances our knowledge of their behavior under climate change.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

The work could potentially be useful for the surface-plasmon-mediated electrical detection of chiral objects to distinguish enantiomers that are otherwise indistinguishable.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

This transition happens in the vicinity of zero energy which is surprising when compared to the influence of random flux on a simple square-lattice model. The authors analytically discover the importance of sublattice degrees of freedom for the transition to happen.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 106, L081410] Published Mon Aug 29, 2022",
