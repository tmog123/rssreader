Raichev\nIn the hydrodynamic regime of electron transport, the distribution of electrical currents and potentials inside a conductor are determined by the Navier-Stokes equation with boundary conditions. The derivation of the boundary conditions from kinetic theory includes both an approximate approach, expressing them through the electronic viscosity, and a more accurate approach, implying numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation. With magnetic field, the results of the two approaches are considerably different when the mean free path length determined by electron-electron collisions is comparable to the cyclotron radius.\n\n[Phys.

The authors show that even when the model parameters are fine-tuned to achieve a balance between gain and loss in the semiclassical limit, the fluctuations of the bath lead to a gradual loss of nonclassicality and entanglement between the modes.\n\n[Phys.

This theory allows computation of the optical response beyond the conventional Drude-Lorentz model.

Here, the authors unveil a pronounced anisotropic spin-orbit splitting with a Rashba-type spin polarization in the electronic interface states in the model system Te/Au(100). Exploring the momentum-dependent response of inversion symmetry breaking, they particularly demonstrate that the orbital texture leads to a strongly anisotropic spin and orbital Rashba effect.

The authors prepare LLS in an anisotropic environment of a liquid crystal and observe its survival across the phase transition to the isotropic phase. This study could pave the way for trapping LLS in the symmetric spin pair of an isotropic phase after breaking symmetry in an anisotropic phase, and motivate the realization of LLS in the solid phase, which will have implications for solid-state qubits toward achieving longer lifetimes in addition to long-range interactions.\n\n[Phys.

Here, the authors put forward a generalization of this scheme for excitons, correlated electron-hole pairs that dictate the optical properties of materials. Much as MLWFs have transformed our understanding of electrons in solids, from chemical bonding to polarization to topology, these maximally localized exciton Wannier functions should deepen our understanding of photophysical and excited-state phenomena of materials.\n\n[Phys.

Kivelson\nThe lowest-order Josephson coupling between d-wave superconductors vanishes by symmetry when the twist angle is close to 45 degrees. The authors propose here an “order by disorder” mechanism, whereby spatial fluctuations in the local Josephson coupling generate an effective higher-order coupling, leading to a time reversal symmetry breaking superconducting phase at the twisted interface. This mechanism may offer an explanation for recent experiments in twist junctions between high-Tc cuprate superconductors. These findings have broader implications for high-Tc cuprate physics, requiring a local admixture of an s-wave component in the d-wave order parameter.\n\n[Phys. Rev.
