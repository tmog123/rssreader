These are formed due to the strain field between graphene and the substrate, and their spatial orientations and shapes arise from minute variations therein. In this work, the authors used low-energy electron microscopy and moire pattern analysis to map out local variations in orientation, strain, and dislocation distribution. This creates a better understanding of the growth process of graphene on silicon carbide (and similar two-dimensional materials) to enable their use in practical applications.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

The presence of magnetic frustration in such materials brings about additional complexity. Here, the authors present a comprehensive study on the ground-state properties of LuFe4Ge2, a ternary intermetallic compound with magnetic frustration and quasi-one-dimensional structure, elucidating the interplay of structure and magnetism. In contrast to the well-studied two-dimensional iron pnictides with competing exchange interactions, LuFe4Ge2 exhibits quasi-one-dimensional chains of geometrically frustrated Fe tetrahedra. It displays a magnetostructural transition at ambient pressure with a change in symmetry from tetragonal to orthorhombic, similar to that in the iron-pnictides, which evolves in an unexpected way under the application of hydrostatic pressure. In that way the intermetallic LuFe4Ge2 material family offers a new perspective on the entanglement of crystal structure and magnetism.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 107, 125136] Published Thu Mar 16, 2023",

The authors establish the timescales involved in thermally driven charge transfer, ultimately refuting the assumption of Fermi-level uniformity on the timescales over which optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectroscopy experiments are typically performed for NV centers in diamond. Their results reveal the potential for noninvasive determination of defect distances and average defect concentrations through ODMR spectroscopy.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Using x-ray diffraction, the authors identify the subtle structural displacements associated with this ordering. The displacements are not confined to a single copper-oxygen layer but rather propagate over a surprisingly large distance through the crystal. The authors attribute this effect to the weak c-axis charge screening in cuprates and suggest that this effect could help couple the charge-density wave between adjacent planes in the crystal.\n\n[Phys.

The degree of spin polarization of the condensate depends on the excitation power and polarization of the laser.

The corner shape exhibits a striking universality that is characterized by the radius of curvature and corner angle at the tip, which remains nearly constant over a wide range of flow conditions. Knowledge of the corner angle allows one to determine the global jump shape, as defined by a dimensionless geometry number related to the isoperimetric inequality, thus giving a complete description of the jump shape.\n\n[Phys.

Unfortunately, using such calculations to identify SPTs numerically is notoriously difficult. Here, the authors develop a numerical method mapping this computation to a one-dimensional problem by utilizing the local nature of the quantum circuits that generate any SPT. Its application to models with Ising symmetry fully confirms field-theoretic predictions for their entanglement spectrum. Additionally, nontrivial deformations of the SPT manifest as many-body Aharonov-Bohm fluxes in the entanglement spectrum.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 107, 115113] Published Mon Mar 06, 2023",

Transport measurements reveal its semimetallic nature, which is further confirmed by ab initio calculations on the partially disordered L21 structure, experimentally synthesized by the authors. The most striking feature is theasymmetric magnetoresistance variation with field at room temperature, clearly revealing spin-valve behavior. Disorder-induced ferrimagnetic regions within the ferromagnetic host are proposed to be the reason for this behavior.

Nonetheless, the authors show that it can support topological quantum spin excitations with exotic spin-multipolar properties if spin conservation is broken. These excitations are superpositions of dipolar magnons and quadrupolar two-magnon bound states. As a result of their topology, such quantum ferromagnets exhibit both chiral edge excitations, akin to edge states in Chern insulators but at finite energy, and an intrinsic thermal Hall effect.\n\n[Phys.

Instead, well-defined excitations are observed that are accurately modeled using linear spin wave theory with high-spin S=3/2 and biaxial single-ion anisotropy, giving insight for the reasons behind the absence of exotic states.\n\n[Phys.

They consider the Goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of Lorentz boosts, and derive a soft theorem for scattering amplitudes. As an application, the authors show that the Dirac-Born-Infeld Inflation is the unique theory that has an emergent Lorentz invariance when the boosts are spontaneously broken.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Here, the authors combine symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations to understand the origin of low-energy polarization switching in the Aurivillius-phase ferroelectrics SrBi2Ta2O9 and SrBi2Nb2O9. They show that polarization reverses via a low-energy two-step process facilitated by nonpolar structural order parameter rotations.

Tin atoms are heavy, though, and generating photons with identical wavelength and linewidth from multiple Sn-V emitters is challenging, due to the strain in the diamond host material. This study shows that multiple Sn-V centers, formed deep within bulk diamond by ion implantation and high-temperature annealing, emit nearly identical photons. This leads to two-photon interference from distant centers, an important step toward building quantum network nodes.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 19, 024061] Published Thu Feb 23, 2023",

Bustard, Duncan England, and Benjamin Sussman\nTime-bin qudits, which are valued in quantum communication protocols for their efficiency and robustness, are made by encoding information into the relative arrival times of photons. However, their practicality has been limited due to the difficulty of the measurements needed to extract this information. Here, the authors demonstrate an effective experimental technique that uses active and passive optical elements to conduct single-shot measurements of ultrafast four-time-bin qudits.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Canfield\nIdentification of ambient-temperature ferromagnets is crucial for advancing established and emerging technologies including energy production, memory storage, and spintronics. The authors outline the discovery and basic properties of the compound Cr1+xPt5−xP, the first ternary material in the Cr-Pt-P phase space. Sizable single crystals of Cr1+xPt5−xP are grown from solution by adding Cr into Pt-P based melts. Cr1+xPt5−xP adopts a tetragonal P4/mmm crystal structure composed of CrPt3 slabs that span the ab-plane and that are separated by sheets of P atoms along the c-axis. Cr1+xPt5−xP is a ferromagnetic metal with a high Curie temperature TC = 464.5(5) K and extremely strong planar anisotropy with estimated anisotropy fields HA = 345 kOe and 220 kOe at 1.8 K and 300 K respectively.\n\n[Phys.

Here and in a companion paper Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 086202 (2023), the author demonstrates that the magnitude of the topological protection length can be explained by spin nonconserving Kondo scattering of edge electrons by holes, localized on background acceptors and residing in the band gap. Surprisingly, doping with Mn ions restores the quantization precision due to the formation of acceptor-bound magnetic polarons that destroy the Kondo effect.\n\n[Phys. Rev.
