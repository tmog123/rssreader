It is shown that the transition process which is initiated by the amplification of perturbations in a separated shear layer downstream of the trip wire is accelerated by the injection of polymer leading to an earlier breakdown to turbulence. However, significant levels of polymer induced drag reduction are noted in the mid-to-late transitioning regions highlighting a critical shear stress based onset criteria for activation of drag reduction.\n\n[Phys.

This study shows that these uncharted effects are not restricted to NdBi, but also emerge in other rare-earth monopnictides. Also, it shows that the relative intensity of the new bands and splitting of these bands scale with the magnetic moments of the rare-earth elements.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Here, the authors return to the classic example of Cu2OSeO3 to tackle a remaining issue: external magnetic field dependence of higher-order modulations. Performing long-exposure small-angle-neutron scattering, a clear difference was observed for the field dependence of the (1 1 0) and (2 0 0) modulations. Comparison to numerical Monte Carlo simulations suggest the appearance of weak swirling spin structures depending on the strength of the external magnetic field.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Using ultrahigh-quality microwave cavities to measure dielectric loss with parts-per-billion precision, the authors clearly show that using silicon is detrimental to qubit coherence time. The loss tangent found here is an order of magnitude worse than previously measured. This study sheds light on the physical mechanisms behind dissipation in silicon, and highlights the need for further work to fully understand the origin of these losses, and how to mitigate them.\n\n[Phys.

So far, spectral coverage of IRQAS systems has been limited to less than 1 µm. This work reports a wavelength-tunable IRQAS system and an efficient measurement scheme to achieve broadband spectroscopy in a short acquisition time. The successful demonstration of rapid spectral measurement over a wide midinfrared window (1.9–5.2 µm) exhibits the great potential of this technique and paves the way for the use of IRQAS in real-world applications.\n\n[Phys.

Julien\nSpin-stripe order is a property of the high-Tc cuprate La2−xSrxCuO4 that is observed for x ≤ 0.13 but not at larger doping because it is nullified by superconducting order. However, it can be restored by applying intense magnetic fields that erase superconductivity. The present analysis of NMR data sheds light on how glasslike freezing of spin stripes emerges from the field-induced vortex cores and how such field-induced magnetism matters for the interpretation of any experiment below the pseudogap boundary at x = 0.19.\n\n[Phys.

This paper reports the discovery of a topological spin memory effect, which provides a promising new avenue for information encryption and recovery. The authors demonstrate experimentally that antiferromagnetically (AFM)-coupled bubble skyrmion pairs stabilized in a Co/Gd/Pt multilayered film at room temperature evolve into complex in-plane spin textures as the temperature is lowered and then reform completely when warmed back up. Simulations show that Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions play a key role in this spin memory effect and reveal that the topological charge is preserved throughout the spin reorientation transition and recovery.\n\n[Phys.

By using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, the authors identify here a multitude of correlated surface states that exist on bulk 1T-TaSe2 with properties ranging all the way from Mott insulating to strongly metallic Kondo behavior. 1T-TaSe2 thus simulates the full range of the periodic Anderson model within a single crystal by combining electron correlations with variable interlayer coupling.\n\n[Phys.

Using a 3D microscopic model, the authors demonstrate here that disorder in the film is both essential for inducing robust superconductivity and potentially detrimental, as it generates “induced disorder”.

However, when single-ion energetics such as spin-orbit coupling are relevant, such symmetries are not necessarily present, allowing fluctuations of the magnitude of the magnetic moment. These excitations are termed amplitude modes. Here, the authors develop and investigate a theory for such excitations applied to neutron spectroscopy. They focus their attention on magnetic excitations in the low-temperature phase of RbFe2+Fe3+F6 which is based on a noncollinear arrangement of Fe3+ (S=5/2, l≈0) and orbitally active Fe2+(S = 2, l =1) magnetic moments. Conditions for the existence and the observation of amplitude modes are discussed, establishing a convention for predicting and analyzing neutron spectra when spin-orbit coupling is a pertinent energy scale.\n\n[Phys.

Apart from showing significant improvements in quantum memory experiments with multiqubit commercial processors, this approach also boosts the performance of single- and two-qubit gates.

This Laplacian-level meta-GGA is tested on a diverse set of solid-state properties: geometries, cohesive energies, bulk moduli, ferromagnetic moments, monovacancy formation energies, and formation enthalpies.

We study the response of the interface to an ac electric field, which is superposed by either a second ac field of different frequency, or by a dc field. An important control parameter is the mixing ratio, which denotes the relative amplitudes of the different components of the driving signal. For ac/ac driving, gradual variations of the mixing ratio can induce a jump of the pattern wavelength, and for ac/dc driving, the response wavelength can be tuned continuously by adjusting the mixing ratio.\n\n[Phys.

In particular, when the spin excitation spectrum contains a singularity such as a Dirac magnon crossing point, the measured spin-wave dispersion is extremely sensitive to experimental conditions such as sample mosaic, resolution, and data integration range. This work resolves an apparent dichotomy between measured and predicted gaps at Dirac crossing points, and provides guidelines for accurate measurement of magnon gap sizes in candidate materials for magnon spintronics applications.\n\n[Phys.

Based on distance-dependence of Mn-Mn exchange and magnetic structures of other Mn3XN perovskites, a topological noncollinear spin structure is proposed for [001] Mn4N films with perpendicular anisotropy, which is confirmed by temperature-independent anomalous Hall conductivity coexisting with a normal temperature-dependent contribution.

In this study of current-driven switching of chiral AFM order in the classic Weyl semimetal Mn3Sn, time-resolved measurements show that switching is incoherent and occurs over several nanoseconds, owing to self-heating and then cooling of AFM domains in the presence of a Pt overlayer.

The authors address all of those challenges by employing an integrated SiN microring resonator to generate energy-time-entangled quantum frequency microcombs with a wide frequency span and narrow bandwidth modes. Photon pairs are selected and distributed to form a fully and simultaneously connected multiuser quantum network, paving the way to turnkey solutions for large entanglement-based quantum networks.\n\n[Phys.

The latter predicts a tower of light states for large field excursions, while EDE is a scalar field model to alleviate the Hubble tension which indeed requires Planckian field excursions, but also leads to tensions with large-scale structure (LSS) probes. The authors consider exponentially EDE-dependent masses of dark matter with the distance conjecture constant, which supposedly is a positive constant of O(1), as a free parameter. Using a large set of different catalogs of experiments, fitting also LSS data, a mild tension with the swampland distance conjecture is observed that constrains the constant to be significantly less than one. Modifications of the heuristic EDE potential may resolve this conflict.\n\n[Phys. Rev. D 106, 043525] Published Wed Aug 17, 2022",

We show that the staircase structure spontaneously forms in our simulations in a way that is consistent with our theoretical predictions.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Fluids 7, 083801] Published Tue Aug 16, 2022",

This significantly facilitates experimental studies in comparison to the infinite arrays of cavities. However, the main advantage is related to material losses and structural fluctuations in long arrays of rods which quickly saturate the growth of the Q-factor with the number of rods in the periodic array in the GHz range, at least.\n\n[Phys.

The results demonstrate not only how disorder can lead to enhancement of magnetic properties but also provide a route towards further improvements of other desired properties in corresponding oxide thin films.\n\n[Phys.

However, the microscopic mechanism remains unclear. In this letter, the authors propose that the orbital character of the electronic bands near the Fermi level determine the photostriction behavior. They find that photoexciting electrons from strong antibonding valence states to weaker antibonding conduction states leads to lattice contraction as a result of weakened antibonding interaction. Interestingly, using higher excitation energies promotes electrons from deeper nonbonding valence states to antibonding conduction states, resulting in giant lattice expansion. These results rationalize the experimentally observed tunable photostriction in halide perovskites.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Materials 6, L082401] Published Mon Aug 15, 2022",

Here, the authors use capacitance measurements to quantify the lateral variation of the carrier density associated with EPS at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. The very high value of several 1013 cm−2 and the pattern of capacitance variation imply that charged defects are the main factor causing phase separation.
