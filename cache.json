Despite this, the Chern number itself is defined in momentum space, and can only be calculated in a clean crystalline material. The authors propose here a spatial Chern marker defined on physical grounds – as the local cross-conductivity around a chosen point in the bulk of the system. The formulation can be related to several other proposed local measures but has the advantage that it constitutes a physical observable of the system. Examples are probed, showing that it is quantized when calculated sufficiently far from the boundary and resistant against disorder.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 106, 155124] Published Thu Oct 13, 2022",

Available designs have remained severely restricted by the limited dissipation mechanisms for plane wavefronts, and elaborate geometries configured by extensive parametric sweeps. This work proposes a paradigm to realize a dissipated-sound metamaterial cage that can perfectly absorb omnidirectionally radiated cylindrical sound, via hybridizing resonant meta-atoms with geometrical parameters optimized by an inverse-design strategy. The proposal provides a perspective for designing a ventilated absorber to dissipate low-frequency sound.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 18, 044032] Published Thu Oct 13, 2022",

Here, the authors study the absorption of electromagnetic radiation by spin waves in magnetoelectric LiFePO4 in the terahertz (THz) spectral range. Using linearly polarized THz radiation, they establish that there are spin waves that interact with magnetic and electric components of radiation. This is unusual for electron spins since they are susceptible to magnetic fields only. Another striking observation is that the number of spin-wave modes in the THz spectrum exceeds four times the number of modes expected for a four-spin system. Using the mean-field model and the magnetic field dependence of the THz spectra, the authors identify four conventional spin-wave modes in LiFePO4. It is proposed that other THz-active spin-wave modes are more exotic quadrupolar excitations, such as spin-stretching modes and two-magnon excitations.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

The authors overcome this challenge using optical second-harmonic generation on the cuprate Sr2Cu3O4Cl2, allowing direct visualization of the antiferromagnetic microstructure. They discover an unusual 90° domain reorientation transition, which enables deterministic antiferromagnetic switching and causes a divergent domain wall susceptibility that generates sample-sized single-domain antiferromagnetic states.\n\n[Phys.

Polariton lasers, on the other hand, emit coherently in a regime without population inversion. This working regime was initially demonstrated indirectly in vertical cavity systems, and now the present work uses a waveguide geometry to provide direct proof, emphasizing the absence of reciprocity between absorption and stimulated processes within the laser cavity. Moreover, thanks to strong polaritonic gain, this laser features injection sections much shorter than those in standard edge-emitting lasers, opening the door to tighter on-chip integration and multiple functionalities within a cavity.\n\n[Phys.

In this work, the authors attempt to visualize distinct quasiparticles and collective motions from an entanglement perspective.

Conflicting experimental results, however, argue for either a Weyl Kondo semimetallic or a narrow-gap Kondo insulating ground state. Using electrical transport measurements on bulk crystals and microstructure devices under hydrostatic pressure, the authors show that Ce3Bi4Pd3 exhibits a narrow-gap Kondo insulating ground state. The results provide important evidence for the ground state of a sought-after Weyl Kondo semimetal candidate and shed light on the experimental and theoretical search for strongly correlated topological materials.\n\n[Phys.

The effect appears at high magnetic fields when the phonon dispersions are tangential to the magnon dispersion curve. Here, the authors show that the resonance field can be shifted by ~ 2 Tesla to the lower-field side by the Bi substitution in YIG. The result is attributed to the change in the phonon dispersions by the Bi doping. The authors also observe in Bi0.9Y2.1Fe5O12 an enhancement 500% greater than the background magnonic SSE signal at the low temperature of 3 K. Moreover, anisotropic magnon-polaron transport was found through the longitudinal and nonlocal SSE measurements, which provides a clue to further unraveling the physics of magnon-polaron SSEs.\n\n[Phys.

The authors consider emergent quantum spin liquids of interacting S=1/2 moments on the pyrochlore lattice with a breathing anisotropy, where two inequivalent sets of tetrahedra are present. They classify possible Z2 and U(1) quantum spin liquids in this system and find a small number of physically motivated candidates. In particular, two degenerate U(1) spin liquids are identified for the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model. The degeneracy is robust with respect to tuning the breathing anisotropy, but it can be lifted by a finite Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.

Hedrick, and Chengyu Li\nIt has long been unknown why the hawkmoth’s maximum forward flying speed is much lower than the theoretical prediction based on its body mass. Our computational fluid dynamics study revealed that as a hawkmoth’s flight speed increases, its wings inevitably generate a significant amount of negative lift during the upstroke, which renders the hawkmoth incapable of sustaining steady forward flight. A similar trend has also been observed for other insects, including fruit flies and bumblebees. However, birds and other flying vertebrates are able to overcome this limitation by flexing their wings during the upstroke.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Fluids 7, 093104] Published Fri Sep 30, 2022",

The authors investigate spin-current generation in layered systems containing Gd and Tb by studying spin-waves that these spin currents excite in an adjacent ferromagnetic layer. They observe a large discrepancy in spin-current generation between Gd and Tb, which provides a possible explanation for the relative difficulty of achieving AOS in systems containing only Tb as the rare-earth material.\n\n[Phys.

However, unlike their well-established radio-frequency counterparts, these nanoantennas lack a roadmap for their purpose-driven design.

This provides the feasibility to manipulate the nonequilibrium carrier and lattice responses in a variety of materials with similar electronic structure, and benefits the development of future ultrafast optoelectronic devices.\n\n[Phys.

The authors combined inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering measurements to study this structural transition. They determined the low-energy phonon dispersions and detected the relevant phonon branch becoming soft. While theoretical calculations broadly agree with the measured dispersion, a clear non-mean-field behavior is demonstrated at this phase transition, which might be connected with quantum criticality and the superconducting dome.\n\n[Phys.

But what kinds of quantum states are efficiently represented by neural networks? To approach this problem, the authors study here entanglement properties of an ensemble of neural network states represented by random restricted Boltzmann machines. Phases with distinct entanglement features are identified and characterized. In particular, the authors show that these neural network states can look typical in their entanglement profile while still being distinguishable from a typical state by their fractal dimensions.\n\n[Phys.

This study introduces weakly tunable qubits, whose frequency can be tuned over a small range via external magnetic flux. Through theoretical derivation and experimental demonstration, the authors show that these transmonlike qubits—without losing the desired key properties—can be used to avoid frequency collisions in large qubit systems while minimizing the sensitivity to flux noise.

However, the most sensitive and coherent quantum sensing methods work at dc and high-frequency fields only. This study utilizes a quantum oscilloscope approach to bridge this gap. The resulting algorithm has a frequency-independent sensitivity and is able to work in the zero-field region.

This saves a considerable amount of computing time over relativistic Hartree-Fock calculations with nonlocal potentials. The PCF-PK1 is obtained by fitting nuclear matter and finite nuclei, including the results of ab-initio calculations; it eliminates spurious shell closures at Z=58 and 92; and it accurately reproduces Gamow-Teller resonances in closed-shell nuclei. This new covariant density functional PCF-PK1 with exchange correlation is expected to provide a unified and consistent description for both nuclear ground states and excited states, in particular for unstable nuclei far from stability.\n\n[Phys.

Adding a Λ hyperon, a sibling of the nucleon with a strange quark, to light nuclei promises new insights as its isospin impurity must impact CSB in mirror hypernuclei, where the only good data available are for A=4. The authors use an ansatz that relates the charge-symmetry-breaking ΛN interaction to the ΛN↔ΣN strong-interaction coupling via the small isospin-one admixture the Λ obtains from the Σ0, as both are members of an SU(3) baryon octet and have an u-d-s quark structure. Once the large CSB observed in mirror hypernuclei Λ4H and Λ4He is reproduced, the deduced isospin-one admixture of the Λ when inside these hypernuclei matches that in free space, provided SU(3) symmetry is partially conserved for these baryons. This approach can be tested in heavier hypernuclei when precise data for CSB become available.\n\n[Phys. Rev. C 106, L031001] Published Tue Sep 20, 2022",

In contrast to 3d-electron vdW magnets, very few f-electron vdW magnets have been studied. Here, the authors report the physical properties of Ce2Te5 single crystals, a layered 4f-electron vdW magnet. Four consecutive (magnetic) phase transitions at ∼ 5.2, 2.1, 0.9, and 0.4 K are observed, suggesting competing antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic exchange interactions.
