Based on a stochastic extension of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory, this article presents accurate microscopic calculations of multinucleon transfer for the 250Cf+232Th system at Ec.m.=950 MeV.

From the topological operator that extracts this marker, one can further define a nonlocal marker that detects topological phase transitions. Several prototype models such as the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, Majorana chain, Chern insulator, Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model, chiral and helical p-wave superconductors, three-dimensional time-reversal symmetric topological insulators, among many others, are employed to demonstrate the ubiquity of these markers.\n\n[Phys.

While visons are static in the ideal model, certain perturbations can induce their motion. Here, it is demonstrated that the vison dynamics induced by Zeeman perturbations are sharply distinct in the ferromagnetic versus the antiferromagnetic model. Namely, in the ferromagnetic model the vison has a trivial translational symmetry and zero Berry curvature, whereas in the antiferromagnetic model it experiences a π flux per unit cell and has two bands with opposite Chern numbers, leading to an intrinsic contribution to the thermal Hall effect.\n\n[Phys.

This study demonstrates the unidirectional nature of the mode propagation, paving the way for the generation of a high-power microwave beam with high coherence and narrow bandwidth.

Although breath figures mature usually slowly, we show that the droplets pattern evolves here dramatically in a few milliseconds leading to a strong droplets number reduction above a threshold in acceleration. We interpret this by the droplets radii oscillations produced which then induce droplets contacting and coalescing with each other in a fascinating manner. Introducing an effective Bond number, coupling the droplets’ average initial radii and the acceleration amplitude, leads to a data collapse on a single master curve.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Here, the authors propose a new signature, relying on Andreev reflection, which distinguishes BEC from BCS superconductors. They demonstrate that, in a standard tunneling spectroscopy setup, a BEC superconductor exhibits suppressed Andreev reflection; however, if the tunneling barrier becomes a potential well, then appreciable Andreev reflection can be revived.

Substituting yttrium rapidly drives the remaining europium divalent, whereas lanthanum has the opposite effect. Analysis shows that average site volumes play a dominant role in the valence distribution suggesting that local strains matter more than electron count. Remarkably, lanthanum substitution also promotes valence instability leading to the appearance of intermediate valence “Eu2.5+”, the fraction of which increases with both lanthanum content and temperature. Extrapolation of the onset temperature to zero lanthanum predicts Tonset ∼ 340 K matching recent reports of a structural transition attributed to a loss of valence order.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Howland, Roberto Verzicco, and Detlef Lohse\nAt steep ice faces submerged in the ocean, convection is driven by differences in salt concentration, yet ablation of the ice is controlled by a mixture of heat and salt fluxes. The differing molecular diffusivities of heat and salt play a key role in setting these fluxes due to thin, diffusive boundary layers at the ice-ocean interface. We analyze such boundary layers by simulating convection between two vertical plates of fixed temperature and salinity, and varying their relative diffusivities, finding that the ratio of fluxes transitions between scaling regimes at a critical Prandtl number. These results provide physical insight for future parameterization of steep ice-ocean interfaces.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Fluids 8, 013501] Published Wed Jan 04, 2023",

Its models are typically based on clinical observations and are not consistently predictive. This study employs an approach based on both fluid dynamics and solid mechanics to uncover the flow-tissue interplay that may anticipate the development of heart failure. The physiological fluid-structure interaction is analyzed in children with a single right ventricle (SRV), where the right ventricle has been surgically transformed to take on the role of an underdeveloped left ventricle.

The epitaxy of such structures becomes increasingly challenging as their thickness increases, due to the accumulation of strain and defects. This study proves that ultrahigh-vacuum chemical vapor deposition allows for subnanometer control of the compositional profile throughout micrometer-thick strain-compensated multilayered structures with very low defect density.

This underexplored regime is realized in CeLiBi2, which is found to exhibit multiple atypical quantum phases including incommensurate cycloidal magnetic order, hard-axis metamagnetism, large and linear magnetoresistance, and mobile ultralight carriers. These results indicate that CeLiBi2 is an ideal material to experimentally and theoretically explore simultaneous quantum phenomena and their interdependent relationships.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Here, the authors study the effects of mechanical strain on skyrmions in FeGe with x-ray magnetic holographic imaging and small angle x-ray scattering, and demonstrate enhancement of the metastable skyrmion energy barriers. Real-space imaging of the magnetization allows the authors to quantify the impact of strain on the magnetic spin textures, and discuss the effects of helical reorientations on skyrmion stability and metastability.\n\n[Phys.

In this work, the authors use a specific electron spin resonance technique, based on photoconductivity measurements using graphene-based terahertz detectors, to probe zero-field splittings of graphene as a function of temperature. They demonstrate experimentally that the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and the staggered sublattice potential, which reduces the topological gap, are both temperature dependent.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

To try to learn how magnetism develops in ultrathin systems, we measure, but deducing the physics afterward is an ill-posed problem. This study uses neural networks to facilitate the reconstruction of the underlying magnetic textures of thin magnets through measurements of their stray fields. The technique is surprisingly robust to experimental noise, and can reliably reconstruct magnetism in arbitrary directions. Importantly, prior training of the network is not required, and the technique is broadly applicable for solving ill-posed inverse problems when the forward problem is well defined.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Their twofold model shows excellent agreement with experimental results. While prior studies have focused on tailoring unit-cell structure to obtain a desired multistable behavior, here the viscous fluid allows tuning of rate-dependent properties and nonlocal interaction between unit cells. The ability to manipulate both structural and nonlocal rate-related properties points to the development of smart materials with tunable kinetic relations, large reversible deformations, and tailored dynamic properties.\n\n[Phys.

This is achieved by combining the strengths of two experimental techniques: the frequency broadband capabilities of ferromagnetic resonance and the precise determination of non-reciprocal propagation via propagating spin wave spectroscopy. This new experimental approach allows to separate the top and bottom perpendicular surface anisotropies often measured together in thin films, and it provides new light into the technologically-relevant ferromagnet/MgO interfaces and their effect on spin waves.\n\n[Phys.

Here, the authors show that by driving supercurrent through the sample optical transitions across the superconducting gap become allowed even in clean single-band systems. As the signal depends strongly on the superconducting pairing as well as on the underlying normal state, supercurrent-driven optical conductivity provides a new way of determining the superconducting state properties.\n\n[Phys.

However, leakage of the qubits out of their computational subspace may be a problem for such a realization. The authors show that, while leakage is indeed a serious problem for the realization of a DTC, it is not insurmountable - one can mitigate leakage by applying a magnetic field that alternates from one qubit to the next.\n\n[Phys.

Its security analysis is challenging, though, and extra assumptions or modifications are typically employed. Here the authors propose minor modifications to COW-QKD’s prepared states while retaining the original, fully passive measurement device, and generalize the “universal squashing” framework to analyze their system’s security. The results suggest that performance should be comparable to upper bounds from the literature, making this protocol a viable alternative to one based on phase-modulated coherent states.\n\n[Phys.

          "description": "Author(s): Daichi Hirobe, Yoji Nabei, and Hiroshi M. Yamamoto\nChiral conductors exhibit spin-related charge rectification but its controllability is largely unexplored. Here, the authors combine chiral charge rectification with a field-effect transistor of tellurium. They demonstrate a gate-variable hundredfold enhancement of the rectification efficiency and enable quantitative comparison with theoretical calculations which considered chiral spin-momentum locking alongside the Zeeman effect. With this comparison across a wide range of temperature, an unexpected deviation from the conventional theory is revealed, which hints at the relevance of chirality-induced spin selectivity at higher temperatures.\n\n[Phys.

          "description": "Author(s): Anasua Chatterjee, Fabio Ansaloni, Torbjørn Rasmussen, Bertram Brovang, Federico Fedele, Heorhii Bohuslavskyi, Oswin Krause, and Ferdinand Kuemmeth\nIn spin-based quantum processors, each quantum dot of a qubit is populated by exactly one electron, which requires careful tuning of each gate voltage such that it lies inside the charge-stability region (the “Coulomb diamond”) associated with the dot array. However, mapping the boundary of a multidimensional Coulomb diamond by traditional dense raster scanning would take years, so the authors develop a sparse acquisition technique that autonomously learns Coulomb-diamond boundaries from a small number of measurements. Here we have hardware-triggered line searches in the gate-voltage space of a silicon quadruple dot, with smart search directions proposed by an active-learning algorithm.\n\n[Phys. Rev.
