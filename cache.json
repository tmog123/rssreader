Stock\nConventional spin-wave theory of magnetic insulators deals with the investigation of transverse excitations of magnetic moments of fixed length. However, when single-ion energetics such as spin-orbit coupling are relevant, such symmetries are not necessarily present, allowing fluctuations of the magnitude of the magnetic moment. These excitations are termed amplitude modes. Here, the authors develop and investigate a theory for such excitations applied to neutron spectroscopy. They focus their attention on magnetic excitations in the low-temperature phase of RbFe2+Fe3+F6 which is based on a noncollinear arrangement of Fe3+ (S=5/2, l≈0) and orbitally active Fe2+(S = 2, l =1) magnetic moments. Conditions for the existence and the observation of amplitude modes are discussed, establishing a convention for predicting and analyzing neutron spectra when spin-orbit coupling is a pertinent energy scale.\n\n[Phys.

This study demonstrates a simple, effective, and easily scalable scheme for dynamical decoupling to slash crosstalk. The scheme uses existing logic gates and does not require any additional calibrations or complexity. Apart from showing significant improvements in quantum memory experiments with multiqubit commercial processors, this approach also boosts the performance of single- and two-qubit gates.

This Laplacian-level meta-GGA is tested on a diverse set of solid-state properties: geometries, cohesive energies, bulk moduli, ferromagnetic moments, monovacancy formation energies, and formation enthalpies.

An important control parameter is the mixing ratio, which denotes the relative amplitudes of the different components of the driving signal. For ac/ac driving, gradual variations of the mixing ratio can induce a jump of the pattern wavelength, and for ac/dc driving, the response wavelength can be tuned continuously by adjusting the mixing ratio.\n\n[Phys.

In particular, when the spin excitation spectrum contains a singularity such as a Dirac magnon crossing point, the measured spin-wave dispersion is extremely sensitive to experimental conditions such as sample mosaic, resolution, and data integration range. This work resolves an apparent dichotomy between measured and predicted gaps at Dirac crossing points, and provides guidelines for accurate measurement of magnon gap sizes in candidate materials for magnon spintronics applications.\n\n[Phys.

Based on distance-dependence of Mn-Mn exchange and magnetic structures of other Mn3XN perovskites, a topological noncollinear spin structure is proposed for [001] Mn4N films with perpendicular anisotropy, which is confirmed by temperature-independent anomalous Hall conductivity coexisting with a normal temperature-dependent contribution.

The latter predicts a tower of light states for large field excursions, while EDE is a scalar field model to alleviate the Hubble tension which indeed requires Planckian field excursions, but also leads to tensions with large-scale structure (LSS) probes. The authors consider exponentially EDE-dependent masses of dark matter with the distance conjecture constant, which supposedly is a positive constant of O(1), as a free parameter. Using a large set of different catalogs of experiments, fitting also LSS data, a mild tension with the swampland distance conjecture is observed that constrains the constant to be significantly less than one. Modifications of the heuristic EDE potential may resolve this conflict.\n\n[Phys. Rev. D 106, 043525] Published Wed Aug 17, 2022",

This significantly facilitates experimental studies in comparison to the infinite arrays of cavities. However, the main advantage is related to material losses and structural fluctuations in long arrays of rods which quickly saturate the growth of the Q-factor with the number of rods in the periodic array in the GHz range, at least.\n\n[Phys.

Here, the authors perform element-sensitive x-ray absorption spectroscopy and magnetometry on high-entropy oxide perovskite thin films, shedding light on how different transition metal elements contribute to the overall magnetic response. The results demonstrate not only how disorder can lead to enhancement of magnetic properties but also provide a route towards further improvements of other desired properties in corresponding oxide thin films.\n\n[Phys.

However, the microscopic mechanism remains unclear. In this letter, the authors propose that the orbital character of the electronic bands near the Fermi level determine the photostriction behavior. They find that photoexciting electrons from strong antibonding valence states to weaker antibonding conduction states leads to lattice contraction as a result of weakened antibonding interaction. Interestingly, using higher excitation energies promotes electrons from deeper nonbonding valence states to antibonding conduction states, resulting in giant lattice expansion. These results rationalize the experimentally observed tunable photostriction in halide perovskites.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Materials 6, L082401] Published Mon Aug 15, 2022",

Here, the authors use capacitance measurements to quantify the lateral variation of the carrier density associated with EPS at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. The very high value of several 1013 cm−2 and the pattern of capacitance variation imply that charged defects are the main factor causing phase separation.

Here, they occur even without interactions and switch places with Fermi arcs for different surface terminations – a property the authors exploit to pinpoint Luttinger arcs for Co and Sn terminations in Co3Sn2S2.\n\n[Phys.

Here, the authors study dense arrays of skyrmions in a thin film heterostructure, showing that the skyrmions form a liquid, the properties of which depend strongly on the size and density of the skyrmions. The presence of pinning sites alters the behavior of the skyrmion liquid compared to typical liquids, but these pinning sites are shown to have a narrow energy distribution compatible with proposed applications.\n\n[Phys.

In this manuscript, the authors study delicate topological insulators protected by crystalline symmetries. They demonstrate that sharp boundaries of these insulators possess conducting states, while states localized at nonsharp boundaries are generically insulating but have anomalous symmetry eigenvalues. These boundary signatures are qualitatively unique among the known topological insulators.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 106, 075124] Published Wed Aug 10, 2022",

The study adds ten new BBH mergers to existing catalogs and provides further evidence for the significance level of previously identified events. The new events display interesting new features that include unexplored ranges of the effective spin and mass ratio, they challenge aspects of stellar collapse models, and have implications for BBH formation channels and black hole mass gaps.\n\n[Phys.

Carpenter, Yu Liang, Mary-Louise Timmermans, and Eyal Heifetz\nIn many convective flows of geophysical relevance the Earth’s rotation is able to provide a control on the rate of heat transfer. The physical mechanisms of this process are the subject of this paper, where a linear model is used to break down the onset of convection into understandable elements that can be quantified and compared. The physical processes acting to control the onset of convection in rotating flows are found to differ depending on the parameters of the problem. Thus no simple universal mechanism can be identified.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Fluids 7, 083501] Published Thu Aug 04, 2022",

However, low-power operation is largely incompatible with deterministic logic, because the temperature required for fast operation reduces the coupling too much. This study overcomes that problem using local, selective plasmon-assisted photoheating of individual nanomagnets to drive a logic gate deterministically toward the desired low-energy output state, on nanosecond time scales. This approach demonstrates the possibility of computational metamaterials and could have immediate technological relevance.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 18, 024014] Published Thu Aug 04, 2022",

However, the microscopic details governing this conductance are poorly understood. Here, the authors fabricate a three-terminal device, based on an InSb nanowire proximitized by a thin Al layer. They show that the measured nonlocal conductance is a nonequilibrium process carried by charge-neutral quasiparticles, taking place at the energy of the superconducting gap.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Here, the authors identify CsV3Sb5 as a Dirac nodal-line semimetal by determining multiple Dirac nodal lines and loops close to the Fermi level with the help of ARPES and first-principles calculations. These nodal lines and loops could provide yet another source for obtaining larger Berry curvature and, hence, larger anomalous Hall conductivity, thus offering essential insight into the exotic transport behavior observed.\n\n[Phys.

One proposed mechanism for dendrite growth is the direct reduction of lithium ions, due to residual electronic conductivity in the nominally insulating solid electrolyte. This article presents a fully first-principles scheme for modeling the electronic conductivity of nominally insulating materials, such as solid electrolytes, as a function of synthesis protocol, and applies this to the prototypical lithium-ion solid electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O2 (LLZO). LLZO is predicted to have low bulk electronic carrier mobilities and negligible carrier concentrations. This suggests that the bulk electronic conductivity of LLZO is not sufficiently high to enable lithium-dendrite growth, implicating extended defects and surface contributions in any non-negligible electronic conductivity in lithium garnet solid electrolytes.\n\n[Phys.
