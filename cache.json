Yet, it is standard for first-principles exciton calculations to sample the entire Brillouin zone uniformly, at great computational cost and resulting in underconverged exciton binding energies. Here, the authors demonstrate that a straightforward-to-implement nonuniform sampling approach yields highly converged exciton binding energies, which can significantly differ from previous best theoretical estimates, at a fraction of the computational expense of uniform sampling approaches. This will enable the prediction of exciton binding energies of increasingly complex materials.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 235117] Published Mon Dec 04, 2023",

Here, we examine a previously neglected aspect of the problem: The compressibility of the injected gas. We use experiments, numerical simulations, and an axisymmetric model to show that gas compression controls the time-dependent injection rate and systematically delays the onset of viscous fingering at high capillary number. We quantify the importance of gas compression with a single dimensionless compressibility number.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Fluids 8, 113904] Published Wed Nov 29, 2023",

This study of spin-wave transduction focuses on the interaction between spin waves and microwaves, and the impact of the spin-wave dispersion relation. The authors choose specific magnetization orientations so that the magnons and microwave photons do not couple, and show that line-shaped dispersion relations can be harnessed to engineer reconfigurable, nonreciprocal frequency filters transferring spin wave energy in a unidirectional manner.\n\n[Phys.

In fact, measurements of the antineutrino flux from reactors have shown a deficit with respect to predictions, which has become known as the reactor antineutrino anomaly. This work combines a careful analysis of up-to-date nuclear decay data with advanced theoretical corrections to the V-A theory of β decay to produce, for the first time, a flux prediction with a comprehensive uncertainty budget. This new prediction achieves a better agreement with existing experimental neutrino data and methodically pins down points for improvements. It will likely stimulate targeted research to check and improve the experimental inputs, with potentially wide-ranging impact, from weak-interaction physics to many aspects of nuclear reactor science and technology.\n\n[Phys.

A pressing challenge is to unravel the intriguing pairing mechanism within these materials. Here, the authors point out a novel role of Hund’s rule to transmit the superexchange coupling of the dz2 orbital to the dx2−y2 orbital, which is a key factor for understanding the remarkably high Tc. The transmitted Hund coupling makes the dx2−y2 orbital feel a large interlayer spin coupling but no interlayer hopping, a situation not explored before. Within one-orbital mean-field theory, the authors find robust s-wave pairing even at 50% hole doping. Moreover, they propose a new analytical framework, the so-called type-II t-J model, which they argue is the minimal model to incorporate all essential ingredients, including large Hund’s coupling and two orbital effects. This work offers a new model, develops a pioneering method, and identifies intriguing pairing mechanisms in the emerging nickelate field.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 174511] Published Tue Nov 21, 2023",

A fundamental assumption of MOST is that velocity near the surface does not follow a logarithmic profile due to buoyancy effects driven by stratification. In contrast to MOST, we find that buoyancy does not change the logarithmic nature of velocity profiles but instead modifies the slope of the log law. The proposed logarithmic profile can serve as an alternative to MOST, possibly leading to more realistic predictions of weather and climate, especially in polar regions.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Umar\nHeavy-ion fusion is a major research area, and practical approaches to describe the evolution of the nucleon movement across the barrier between the two nuclei are highly relevant for elucidating the essential dynamics of the fusion process. When two nuclei approach each other to distances where the nuclear force becomes active, neutrons and protons could move from one nucleus to the other. This movement could open and facilitate the pathway to fusion. The authors employ a microscopic many-body approach based on the density-constrained time-dependent Hartree-Fock calculations to study the impact of isospin (i.e., proton versus neutron) dynamics on low-energy nuclear fusion along an isotope chain and its dependence on the deformation of the colliding nuclei. In asymmetric systems, iso-vector dynamics plays a significant role. Its typical effect is a reduction in the potential barrier, which turns into enhancement for neutron-rich systems. These effects could be studied at facilities that provide beams of exotic, unstable nuclei.\n\n[Phys. Rev. C 108, L051602] Published Tue Nov 14, 2023",

Here, the authors investigate a prominent example: HHG in GaAs can be enhanced by elliptically polarized light excitation. Remarkably, the enhancement is accompanied by emergent nonlinear optical activity, and it become salient only at particular “intermediate” excitation strengths. These results indicate that the key for HHG enhancement lies in the interference among nonlinear emission processes, revealing that not only material properties but optimal-strength excitations are important for controlling HHG properties via fine-tuning of the nonlinear dynamics.\n\n[Phys.

It does not have a well-defined thermodynamic phase transition, but is typically characterized by a temperature TCDW, below which spatial coherence begins to grow. Using x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy to study an archetypal cuprate, the authors show here that the atomic relaxation dynamics – an inherent, yet hardly explored property in the doped cuprates – is coupled to this change at TCDW.\n\n[Phys.

An analogous law does not exist for compressible flows due to complexities arising from mean property variations and intrinsic compressibility effects, which occur when pressure directly changes the density of fluid elements. By accounting for both these effects, we propose a new velocity scaling that transforms the mean velocity of compressible flows to the incompressible law of the wall. This transformation is more accurate than the state-of-the-art, and is applicable to a wider range of flows.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Fluids 8, L112601] Published Thu Nov 09, 2023",

Neutron diffraction experiments done here find that the crystal structure undergoes a sequence of transitions from tetragonal to incommensurate to orthorhombic, with the latter two exhibiting staggered displacements of the cesium ions. The symmetry of this structure permits antisymmetric exchange, which is consistent with a canted antiferromagnetic structure also observed, and a nice example of a structure-property relationship.\n\n[Phys.

Here, the authors show, in a mechanistic study, that these fluctuations originate from spin-flip scattering mediated by charge puddles via a Kondo-type interaction, an effect which is expected to occur in any narrow-gap quantum spin Hall insulator.\n\n[Phys.

Here, the authors propose a simple, analytical expression that captures the measured ZFS over a wide range of temperatures. The authors explain the physical motivations for this expression and suggest that similar expressions may apply to other properties of the NV center, as well as to other solid-state spin systems.\n\n[Phys.

Vortices in this two-dimensional liquid form a network of percolating paths, due to the combined effect of pinning and intervortex interaction. While some vortices remain static, others move on this network, with their relative fractions changing with magnetic field, temperature, and applied current.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Our model recovers the dynamical modes of surfer pairs found in experiments, and predicts that surfer collectives may lock into a variety of quantized bound states. Generally, our work shows that capillary surfers are a promising platform for studying wave-coupled active matter.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Fluids 8, 114001] Published Tue Nov 07, 2023",
