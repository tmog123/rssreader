Crucial neutrino calibration experiments, however, using intense β-decay sources, yielded rates below that predicted by theory. A recent effort to check the “gallium anomaly” using a more intense source exacerbated the discrepancy. This paper carefully reexamines the nuclear physics of neutrino absorption on 71Ga, slightly reducing but not eliminating the puzzling anomaly.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Within the framework of the generator coordinate method with a Gogny interaction, this paper highlights the important role of hexadecapole deformation in several isotopes of the rare earth region. These features could also have an impact on the evaluation of neutrinoless double-β decay nuclear matrix elements and on heavy ion collision dynamics. The study highlights that the physics touched by considering the hexadecapole degree of freedom is not trivial, and its study is worth further consideration.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

In a first step they compute the energy and particle densities of a nucleus using the Skyrme Kohn-Sham + Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer method. With those sets of data and a deep-learning approach they then train an orbital-free functional. When applied to the 24Mg nucleus, the newly constructed functional successfully reproduces the binding energy of the original Skyrme-EDF, with an accuracy of about 40 keV. The significant computational advantage compared to traditional EDF approaches promises useful alternatives for future applications such as for calculating more complex nuclear shapes in heavy and superheavy nuclei.\n\n[Phys.

By measuring the fermion scaling dimension at the critical point, the authors provide evidence for fermion fractionalization into deconfined emergent particles, supporting the hypothesis that the transition is a fermionic deconfined quantum critical point. The numerical results, including the critical exponent and fermion dimension, agree with theoretical predictions.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 125130] Published Wed Sep 20, 2023",

Here, the authors use nanowires of Cd3As2 – a Dirac semimetal – to hunt for these signatures by simultaneously looking at Josephson radiation and Shapiro patterns at different doping levels. By cross-checking the experimental results with an extensive (RCSJ) model that includes thermal noise, it is concluded that trivial supercurrent dominates and that topological supercurrent, if existent, falls below the detection limit of the setup.\n\n[Phys.

Reinert\nThe orbital Rashba effect describes the formation of chiral orbital angular momentum textures upon inversion symmetry breaking at surfaces or interfaces. Here, the authors unveil a pronounced anisotropic spin-orbit splitting with a Rashba-type spin polarization in the electronic interface states in the model system Te/Au(100). Exploring the momentum-dependent response of inversion symmetry breaking, they particularly demonstrate that the orbital texture leads to a strongly anisotropic spin and orbital Rashba effect. These findings will provide a valuable contribution to the discovery and understanding of future “orbitronic” phenomena.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, L121107] Published Thu Sep 14, 2023",

The authors prepare LLS in an anisotropic environment of a liquid crystal and observe its survival across the phase transition to the isotropic phase. This study could pave the way for trapping LLS in the symmetric spin pair of an isotropic phase after breaking symmetry in an anisotropic phase, and motivate the realization of LLS in the solid phase, which will have implications for solid-state qubits toward achieving longer lifetimes in addition to long-range interactions.\n\n[Phys.

Here, the authors put forward a generalization of this scheme for excitons, correlated electron-hole pairs that dictate the optical properties of materials.

The authors propose here an “order by disorder” mechanism, whereby spatial fluctuations in the local Josephson coupling generate an effective higher-order coupling, leading to a time reversal symmetry breaking superconducting phase at the twisted interface. This mechanism may offer an explanation for recent experiments in twist junctions between high-Tc cuprate superconductors. These findings have broader implications for high-Tc cuprate physics, requiring a local admixture of an s-wave component in the d-wave order parameter.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Glazov, Jens Hübner, and Michael Oestreich\nSpin noise spectroscopy on single quantum dots (QDs) has matured to a highly efficient method to study the spin and charge dynamics of semiconductor quantum dots, including the subtle impact of their surroundings. Here, the authors extend the theory and the experimental technique of optical spin noise spectroscopy to high magnetic fields and study the fundamental mechanisms of decharging and recharging of (InGa)As QDs at quasiresonant and nonresonant optical excitation. The resulting photoinduced two-way charge dynamics in single QDs is not only interesting from the fundamental point of view but plays an important role in many quantum dot based photonic devices, such as optically addressable qubits or reliable single-photon emitters.\n\n[Phys.

The critical wavelength corresponds to the fastest growing mode and scales with the electric double layer width and the reaction-diffusion length.

As MRAM cells operate above room temperature, it is crucial to determine the damping parameter of the free layer at elevated temperatures. This study uses ferromagnetic resonance techniques to measure the damping of MRAM free layers up to 520 K. The data show significant differences in temperature dependence between conventional and low-damping free-layer designs, paving the way for MRAM cells with lower switching current.

They find that the Ferrell-Glover-Tinkham sum rule is satisfied within an unprecedented accuracy of 2% by integrating the optical conductivity up to 0.6 eV, consistent with the spectral range of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations.\n\n[Phys.

Nevertheless they are considered as paradigmatic candidates for bosonic condensation and the formation of macroscopic coherence in solids. To address both effects, the kinetics of exciton thermalization is studied, including their composite fermionic character. This way, exciton condensation based on the primary assumption of a bosonic thermalization is questioned. In this light, also discussed is whether a recently observed decrease of linewidths at increasing exciton density can be related to a signature for emerging excitonic coherence.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

          "description": "Author(s): Victor Huarcaya, Miguel Dovale Álvarez, Daniel Penkert, Stefano Gozzo, Pablo Martínez Cano, Kohei Yamamoto, Juan José Esteban Delgado, Moritz Mehmet, Karsten Danzmann, and Gerhard Heinzel\nTo reach subpicometer sensitivities in the millihertz frequency range, inertial sensors based on laser interferometry must reduce laser-frequency noise, typically by using ultrastable optical reference cavities or atomic or molecular references. This study presents a simpler solution: a quasimonolithic Mach-Zehnder interferometer with intentionally mismatched arm lengths, plus two photodiodes at balanced output ports. Here structural stability is transferred to laser frequency via amplification, integration, and feedback of the balanced-detection signal. Improvements to the thermal design and isolation of a compact setup allow stabilities similar to those of reference systems.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 20, 024078] Published Thu Aug 31, 2023",

The authors show that local piezostrain is an efficient extrinsic means to control the gyrotropic motion of magnetic vortices, with low voltages and all-electrical operation. In addition, they find that the frequency-strain tuning ratio scales inversely with the size of the vortex-based microdevice. Their approach offers an extra dimension in the frequency tuning of vortex-based spintronic oscillators.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 20, 024080] Published Thu Aug 31, 2023",
