In this paper, frequency domain methods, which are particularly suited for bound orbital motion, are developed in an innovative way so that they can be applied to study hyperbolic scattering in the “toy” problem of a scalar charge.

By training neural networks on simulated data for the density of states, and then minimizing the effective distance between network-generated images and experimental data, the authors obtain here accurate predictions of tight-binding parameters, validating their results against literature values.

The authors use the dynamic strain of surface acoustic waves to overcome this limitation and efficiently excite spin transitions in the excited states of these color centers up to room temperature. The acoustic spin control of silicon vacancies opens possibilities for the implementation of efficient quantum spin control and sensing protocols using spin optomechanics.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Here, the authors extend the theory and the experimental technique of optical spin noise spectroscopy to high magnetic fields and study the fundamental mechanisms of decharging and recharging of (InGa)As QDs at quasiresonant and nonresonant optical excitation. The resulting photoinduced two-way charge dynamics in single QDs is not only interesting from the fundamental point of view but plays an important role in many quantum dot based photonic devices, such as optically addressable qubits or reliable single-photon emitters.\n\n[Phys.

Parish, and Francesca Maria Marchetti\nShould the optical response of doped two-dimensional semiconductors be described within a Fermi polaron or a trion model? Using a finite-temperature Fermi polaron theory, the authors demonstrate here a crossover from a quantum degenerate regime with a well-defined polaron quasiparticle to an incoherent regime at high temperature or low doping, where the lowest-energy attractive polaron becomes subsumed into a broad trion-hole continuum. The crossover is accompanied by a characteristic evolution of the emission profile, from a symmetric Lorentzian to an asymmetric peak.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 125406] Published Wed Sep 06, 2023",

Nevertheless, comprehending their strongly interacting counterparts presents a significant challenge. Here, the authors developed an innovative lattice model based on U(1)f fermionic charge decorations. The model furnishes a rigorous mathematical framework for delving into fermionic symmetry-protected topological phases that conserve U(1)f charge, among other types of symmetries. Notably, this research expands the existing theoretical landscape by presenting an exactly solvable Hamiltonian with a finite local Hilbert space and a sophisticated classification scheme for continuous symmetries.\n\n[Phys.

Chopdekar, Matthew Carey, Galen Street, Vijaysankar Kalappattil, Keira Leistikow, and Mingzhong Wu\nThe efficiency of spin-transfer-torque magnetic random-access memory (MRAM) critically depends on the damping of the free layer. As MRAM cells operate above room temperature, it is crucial to determine the damping parameter of the free layer at elevated temperatures. This study uses ferromagnetic resonance techniques to measure the damping of MRAM free layers up to 520 K. The data show significant differences in temperature dependence between conventional and low-damping free-layer designs, paving the way for MRAM cells with lower switching current. These insights could impact the development of more efficient and thermally stable MRAM technologies.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 20, 034006] Published Wed Sep 06, 2023",

Nevertheless they are considered as paradigmatic candidates for bosonic condensation and the formation of macroscopic coherence in solids. To address both effects, the kinetics of exciton thermalization is studied, including their composite fermionic character. This way, exciton condensation based on the primary assumption of a bosonic thermalization is questioned. In this light, also discussed is whether a recently observed decrease of linewidths at increasing exciton density can be related to a signature for emerging excitonic coherence.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Tennant\nMagnetic van der Waals materials have many proposed technological uses, but predicting their behavior requires understanding their magnetic interactions. Here, the authors present a comprehensive study of the spin exchange Hamiltonian of semiconducting magnet NiPS3. Using inelastic neutron scattering and first-principles density functional theory calculations, the authors derive a spin-exchange Hamiltonian able to explain spin excitations observed with other probes. Comparing semiclassical simulations against the experimental neutron spectrum reveals an anomalous suppression of low-energy magnetism in NiPS3, signaling nontrivial physics lurking in its ground state.\n\n[Phys.

Here, the authors report a new delicate TI, dubbed a “real Hopf insulator” (RHI), in a spinless PT-symmetric fermion system in three dimensions. Having two topological invariants characterizing both conduction and valence bands, the RHI features a bulk-boundary correspondence and reverting Thouless pump that must be described by using both bands simultaneously. This sheds light on the generic properties of delicate TIs.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 125101] Published Fri Sep 01, 2023",

Due to challenging material requirements, the development of HCSCs has been limited to proof-of-concept devices. By examining heat flow in HCSCs, this study suggests expanding their characterization to include the study of carrier temperatures for various contact configurations and biases. The authors show that hotter is not always better: High carrier temperatures may be a sign of excessively high barriers to extraction—an insight that could adjust expectations and interpretations of hot-carrier temperatures in devices.\n\n[Phys.

This study presents a simpler solution: a quasimonolithic Mach-Zehnder interferometer with intentionally mismatched arm lengths, plus two photodiodes at balanced output ports. Here structural stability is transferred to laser frequency via amplification, integration, and feedback of the balanced-detection signal.

Here, the authors study the consequences of such coupling in polar metals, where one of the polar phonons has undergone a symmetry-breaking transition. They show that application of magnetic field reveals a spectrum of collective modes that can change their character (electronic vs. lattice) and energy as a function of field strength. Optical spectroscopy experiments are shown to have the capability to probe these modes.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 075162] Published Mon Aug 28, 2023",

Additionally, the impacts of point defects on the transport properties of Weyl semimetals are often overlooked. One experimental signature of Weyl nodes is the chiral anomaly, which involves charge pumping between Weyl nodes in reciprocal space. In this study, the authors demonstrate that naturally occurring Pt vacancies in GdPtxSb epitaxial films complicate the identification of the chiral anomaly through magnetotransport measurements. On the other hand, they observe signatures of the topological Hall effect, indicating the presence of chiral spin textures in real space.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Although electric and magnetic field cooling tunes the susceptibility, there is no field-cooling protocol that leads to a pure monopole response.

Among these, nitride perovskites are predicted to possess intriguing physical properties, but they remain underexplored due to the challenges in synthesizing materials without unintentional oxygen incorporation. LaWN3, recently identified as the first fully nitrided perovskite, displays polar symmetry and a large piezoelectric coefficient. However, its predicted polarization switching (common for ferroelectrics) is hindered by a significant leakage current, necessitating a better understanding of its electronic structure and optical properties. This study delves into the structure and optoelectronic properties of thin film LaWN3 in greater detail, employing combinatorial techniques to establish correlations between properties and cation stoichiometry.\n\n[Phys.

Egger\nCharge transport characteristics in optoelectronic devices play a crucial role in their efficiency. Research over the past decades has established strategies to alter charge transport behavior through material design. However, when atomic motion becomes complex at elevated, application-relevant temperatures, the established structure-property relations are less predictive. In this work, the authors take a major step to solve this critical problem by quantitatively connecting vibrational anharmonicity and dynamic disorder in model anharmonic semiconductors. It is reported that the materials’ correlated behavior determine carrier mobilities and their temperature dependencies in halide perovskites, establishing these phenomena as knobs to tune key optoelectronic properties of important optoelectronic materials.\n\n[Phys.

Through experiments and simulations, we characterize the drag on a sphere partially immersed at an air-water interface as a function of submergence depth. The presence of the free surface can induce drag forces several times greater than the equivalent fully submerged case, with pronounced hysteretic effects strongly influenced by the sphere’s wettability. We ascribe the drag increase to an asymmetric pressure loading on the sphere that persists for flows both above and below the minimum capillary-gravity wave speed.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

The authors show here that without vertex corrections there is no pseudogap, but an inclusion of even infinitesimally small vertex corrections gives rise to pseudogap behavior. The authors further generalize this statement to a set of boundary models, in which the pseudogap develops upon inclusion of perturbations.

In practice, precise rotation measurements are essential, from magnetometry to inertial navigation to fundamental tests of physics. The ultimate limits for simultaneously measuring all of the components of a rotation are dictated by quantum theory, and here are tested using light’s orbital angular momentum and multiplane light conversion. Rotated states are projected onto a set of coherent states to deduce the rotation parameters, using a method inspired by GPS. The results are near the ultimate limits of quantum precision.\n\n[Phys.

Existing protocols for global-scale quantum communication demand high-performance quantum memories, which have limited communication distance. This study proposes a chain of satellites in low Earth orbit to directly transmit photonic qubits through space, using the satellites like optical lenses to counter diffraction loss. Simulations and analysis of different quantum communication protocols using this relay system show the feasibility of building a global quantum network of only satellites, without requiring quantum memories.\n\n[Phys.

Quantum annealing offers a breakthrough for such challenges in huge search spaces. The authors propose a combination of quantum annealing, machine learning, and first-principles calculations that is computationally cheaper than ordinary machine learning in designing atomically disordered spinel oxides (promising materials for magnetoresistive devices). Furthermore, the origins of physical properties of interest can be interpreted from the obtained Ising model Hamiltonian.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 20, 024044] Published Thu Aug 17, 2023",

We use direct numerical simulation of the turbulence and Lagrangian tracking of the particles. The particles spatial distribution within the flow domain and their translational statistics is shown to depend almost exclusively on the combined effect of inertia and wall roughness, with weak aspect ratio effects. These effects are observed in the particle orientation statistics: Longer particles exhibit a stronger tendency to align with the mean flow direction, especially at low inertia.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

To this end, they compare small box sizes of simulations with those embedded in larger simulations that include SCC modes that are cut off by the small boxes.

This study shows that ultrastrong coupling can be achieved with a ferrimagnetic film in direct contact with a superconducting resonator. Analysis shows that the diamagnetic coupling term is vanishingly small, suggesting a potential route to superradiant phase transitions.
