The integrated aerodynamic forces and the far-field noise are measured by wind tunnel experiments. Then, near-field flow structures and corresponding noise source analysis are presented based on computational aeroacoustics (CAA) simulations. We found the unique acoustic feature of descending flight is the haystacking-like spectral humps, possibly caused by the interaction between the blade leading edge and the rotor wake.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

The latter is at odds with the observed constraints on the PBH abundance. The authors scrutinize in detail the standard calculation and approximations in determining the PBH abundance and point out several uncertainties, concluding that the PBH abundance is likely much smaller than what is the current consensus.\n\n[Phys.

The authors demonstrate a reliable, efficient, physics-informed tuning algorithm (PIT) for navigating to a target charge configuration⏤a prerequisite to forming qubits. This tuning method combines machine learning and physical intuition with an algorithm that leverages one-dimensional scans (rays) and conventional peak-finding to navigate from a coarse, unknown device state to a desired charge occupation efficiently and effectively. PIT enables the transformation of an uncalibrated circuit to a functioning quantum processor.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 20, 034067] Published Thu Sep 28, 2023",

By analyzing the elastocaloric data, the authors show that a normal-state maximum in the entropy becomes a minimum in the superconducting state. Through modeling of the associated Lifshitz transition, they extract information about the momentum-space structure of the pairing gap function, yielding constraints on the viable pairing states.\n\n[Phys.

Performing measurements on a complementary subsystem, however, can reveal finer nuances in the system’s ability to thermalize. The authors show here that systems that look ‘thermal’ under the lens of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) can be highly ‘nonthermal’ when probed deeper. They illustrate this finding on several constrained models that describe slow relaxation in quantum glasses and quantum many-body scars in Rydberg atom arrays.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

In a first step they compute the energy and particle densities of a nucleus using the Skyrme Kohn-Sham + Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer method. With those sets of data and a deep-learning approach they then train an orbital-free functional. When applied to the 24Mg nucleus, the newly constructed functional successfully reproduces the binding energy of the original Skyrme-EDF, with an accuracy of about 40 keV.

The robustness of the antiferromagnetic state manifested by a high critical metamagnetic field is explained by ab initio calculations that predict a zigzag antiferromagnetic order of V moments described within the J1-J2-J3 model. The observed saturated moment of 1.2 μB/f.u. indicates a significant vanadium orbital moment that is the main ingredient of the strong anisotropy.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

The two complementary techniques of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering and optical spectroscopy allow the authors to draw a comprehensive picture of the electronic excitations and to assess the electronic structure. The accurate set of electronic parameters such as spin-orbit coupling, Hund’s coupling, crystal-field splitting, Mott gap, and charge-transfer energy will serve as a solid reference for future studies on Os compounds.\n\n[Phys.

Here, the authors investigate a quantum theory that treats the interaction between quantum-confined plasmons and optical phonons in semiconductors. This theory allows computation of the optical response beyond the conventional Drude-Lorentz model. In particular, it predicts new effects, such as an oscillator-strength transfer mechanism between phonons and dark plasmon modes.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 125417] Published Thu Sep 14, 2023",

Here, the authors unveil a pronounced anisotropic spin-orbit splitting with a Rashba-type spin polarization in the electronic interface states in the model system Te/Au(100). Exploring the momentum-dependent response of inversion symmetry breaking, they particularly demonstrate that the orbital texture leads to a strongly anisotropic spin and orbital Rashba effect. These findings will provide a valuable contribution to the discovery and understanding of future “orbitronic” phenomena.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, L121107] Published Thu Sep 14, 2023",

The authors prepare LLS in an anisotropic environment of a liquid crystal and observe its survival across the phase transition to the isotropic phase. This study could pave the way for trapping LLS in the symmetric spin pair of an isotropic phase after breaking symmetry in an anisotropic phase, and motivate the realization of LLS in the solid phase, which will have implications for solid-state qubits toward achieving longer lifetimes in addition to long-range interactions.\n\n[Phys.

The authors propose here an “order by disorder” mechanism, whereby spatial fluctuations in the local Josephson coupling generate an effective higher-order coupling, leading to a time reversal symmetry breaking superconducting phase at the twisted interface. This mechanism may offer an explanation for recent experiments in twist junctions between high-Tc cuprate superconductors.

          "description": "Author(s): Christopher Whittall and Leor Barack\nThe self-force problem in gravity is an approach to the two-body problem in which the mass ratio is extreme enough that the smaller-mass body can be usefully treated as a test particle to the lowest order in the mass ratio. In this paper, frequency domain methods, which are particularly suited for bound orbital motion, are developed in an innovative way so that they can be applied to study hyperbolic scattering in the “toy” problem of a scalar charge. Frequency domain methods as developed here may prove to be a promising approach to the full gravitational self-force problem.\n\n[Phys. Rev. D 108, 064017] Published Mon Sep 11, 2023",

By training neural networks on simulated data for the density of states, and then minimizing the effective distance between network-generated images and experimental data, the authors obtain here accurate predictions of tight-binding parameters, validating their results against literature values.

This study uses ferromagnetic resonance techniques to measure the damping of MRAM free layers up to 520 K. The data show significant differences in temperature dependence between conventional and low-damping free-layer designs, paving the way for MRAM cells with lower switching current. These insights could impact the development of more efficient and thermally stable MRAM technologies.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 20, 034006] Published Wed Sep 06, 2023",

This simple insight opens new possibilities for applying FRG methods to models for strongly correlated electrons with projected Hilbert spaces, such as quantum spin models, the t-J model, or the Hubbard model at infinite on-site repulsion. By representing these models in terms of Hubbard X-operators, various applications of this approach are explored.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 115104] Published Tue Sep 05, 2023",

Nevertheless they are considered as paradigmatic candidates for bosonic condensation and the formation of macroscopic coherence in solids. To address both effects, the kinetics of exciton thermalization is studied, including their composite fermionic character. This way, exciton condensation based on the primary assumption of a bosonic thermalization is questioned. In this light, also discussed is whether a recently observed decrease of linewidths at increasing exciton density can be related to a signature for emerging excitonic coherence.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

However, their performance is limited by the current method for generating single electrons by applying Lorentzian voltage pulses on the Fermi sea of a quantum conductor. The authors introduce a Fourier synthesis-based voltage pulse generator, allowing the generation and in-situ characterization of a 27-ps electron wave packet in an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer. This advancement can potentially enable the study of ultrafast dynamics in quantum nanoelectronic systems and the generation of high-frequency flying-electron qubits.\n\n[Phys. Rev.
