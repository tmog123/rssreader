          "description": "Author(s): Adam Denchfield, Hyowon Park, and Russell J. Hemley\nHydrides at high pressures constitute the only materials to be superconducting above 200 K, and are typically marked by an appreciable hydrogen density of states and van Hove singularities at the Fermi energy. Given the recent interest in nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride, the authors focused on finding the structures which would have electronic properties that could plausibly support high-temperature superconductivity within a narrow pressure range. They have identified a narrow range of stoichiometries Lu8H23−xN with hydrogen-dominant conduction states, and found one structure which exhibits a very large hydrogen density of states with an extremely sharp van Hove singularity, whose properties may therefore change dramatically under pressure.\n\n[Phys.

This geometry dependence is calculated here for several defects in h-BN, e.g., CBVN, within constrained density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory. The investigated Stokes shifts show distinct differences compared to experiments. For the Tamm-Dancoff approximation, an approximation frequently employed in the calculation of exciton energies in crystalline solids, the authors find small but significant influence for defect systems.\n\n[Phys.

The authors report here that acoustic S-graphene, i.e., a carbon allotrope of graphene, can harbor two pairs of Dirac cones, further shaping double-kink valley states. By selectively exciting different symmetric or antisymmetric branches, robust yet tunable superdirectional sound radiation is experimentally demonstrated.

These features originate from multifold fermions - higher spin generalizations of Weyl quasiparticles that are protected by crystalline symmetries. Since these materials are prone to intrinsic disorder, the authors theoretically study topological properties of amorphous RhSi and CoSi. Using the spectral localizer, they find that multifold fermions survive disorder strengths that convert the semimetal into a diffusive metal phase. These conclusions are supported by photoemission simulations showing the presence of Fermi arcs in the corresponding disorder range.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Materials 8, L021201] Published Wed Feb 14, 2024",

We show that the degree of the interfacial phase separation scales as a unique function of the ratio of the flow and phase separation rates and it decreases with the ratio. These results demonstrate that the interfacial phase separation is arrested by the imposed flow and determined by competition between the flow and phase separation rates.

The authors employ physics-inspired machine learning to predict the microscopic structural relaxation from amorphous configurations of deeply supercooled liquids. Leveraging the transferability in temperature of the trained networks enables the prediction of dynamic heterogeneities at the experimental glass transition temperature, thereby circumventing the prohibitively large computational cost associated with conventional simulation methods at such low temperatures.\n\n[Phys.

Reaching that island of stability requires a nuclear reaction that will transfer a large number of nucleons from one nucleus to another, such as in the collision of two actinide nuclei, which are heavy and already neutron-rich. In one particular collision scenario, ternary quasifission, the composite system formed by the two colliding nuclei is not in equilibrium, splitting into three fragments, instead of the more commonly observed binary fission process. The authors report a systematic study of ternary quasifission in 238U + 238U collisions in a microscopic framework that has been successfully applied to various nuclear phenomena. They find that including octupole deformation has a pronounced effect on the formation of the middle fragment. For tail-to-tail and tail-to-side collisions, the model calculations predict the formation of very heavy neutron-rich systems in certain energy intervals, a result that is potentially interesting for the synthesis of superheavy elements.\n\n[Phys.

Their results show that exchange effects between the emitted electrons and the atomic bound electrons can considerably impact the shape of the electron spectrum near the endpoint.

Rogachev\nIn 1954 Fred Hoyle postulated that a 7.65 MeV excited state in 12C had to exist for carbon-based life to develop on Earth. During stellar helium burning, such a state allows a short-lived 8Be, formed from two α particles, to resonantly react with a third α particle to form this state which can decay to the 12C ground state via γ or electron-positron pair emission. The branching fraction for this radiative decay determines the amount of 12C produced in stars. A recent experiment suggested that the decay was significantly different from previous results from the 1960’s and 1970’s, adding considerable uncertainty to this important reaction. This paper uses modern detection technology to remeasure the branching ratio with reduced uncertainties compared with the new result and confirms that the earlier results were correct, thus significantly reducing the uncertainty in stellar 12C production.\n\n[Phys.

Fortunately, even a few imperfect MZMs can be used to qualitatively extend the behavior of standard superconducting qubits. Such hybrid devices take advantage of the interplay of Cooper pair tunneling, coherent single-electron tunneling, and Majorana hybridization. Here, the authors offer a detailed description and present various analytical approaches to addressing the complex behavior of the MZM-superconducting qubit hybrid.

          "description": "Author(s): Benjamin Joecker, Holly G. Stemp, Irene Fernández de Fuentes, Mark A. I. Johnson, and Andrea Morello\nQuantum nondemolition measurements (QNDMs) are a precious resource for quantum computing. They are an integral part of the surface code, the holy grail of quantum error correction, and can boost initialization and readout fidelities through repeated measurements. In spin systems, scalable QNDMS are achievable by coupling to ancillary spins read via charge reservoirs. Here, the authors develop a model to quantify how small deviations from true QNDMs in real spin system can introduce bit-flip errors and analyze how they can be minimized.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Contrary to prevailing intuition that the deposited droplet would spread more and evaporate faster, we find that the droplet instead undergoes contraction and in addition it spontaneously and erratically moves, for substrate temperatures well below the boiling point of the liquid. We term this remarkable phenomenon “Autothermotaxis” and show that it originates from the thermal Marangoni flow in the droplet which undergoes an instability. The thermal Marangoni flow is also the reason for the contraction of the droplet.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Fluids 9, L012001] Published Wed Jan 31, 2024",

Neutron diffraction and spectroscopy were employed to examine this compound. We did not observe a superconducting resonance, nor did we observe any predicted Cu-induced structural distortion between 5 and 300 K. No magnetic long-range order or magnetic excitations were detected in this temperature range. We have determined a favored substitution site of copper at the Pb1 site. This may provide crucial insights into the absence of structural distortion and superconductivity in LK-99.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Materials 8, 014605] Published Tue Jan 30, 2024",

This work focuses on variational DFPT for metals, examining the convexity of the entropy function of occupation numbers. It emphasizes benefits from resmearing Fermi-Dirac broadening at finite temperature, details variational expressions for free energy derivatives, and addresses inaccuracies in unperturbed wavefunctions.

However, ubiquitous many-body interactions that do not preserve particle number significantly compromise their topological protection. The authors show here that these interactions can lead to significant edge mode damping, hybridization with bulk modes, and coupling between edge modes on opposite sides.

Crucially, the interaction occurs with those mobile carriers possessing distinguishable quantum numbers (e.g., spin). In monolayer TMD semiconductors, the availability of both spin and valley quantum numbers allows excitons to interact, simultaneously, with more than one type of quantum-mechanically distinguishable carrier. This leads to new types of composite excitons (e.g., six-particle “hexcitons”), which appear as distinct resonances in optical spectra.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 109, L041304] Published Tue Jan 30, 2024",

Amin, and Subhankar Bedanta\nThe authors report here the self-induced inverse spin Hall effect in epitaxial La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) films and perform first-principles calculations of the spin Hall conductivities of bulk LSMO. The LSMO films were prepared using pulsed laser deposition. The spin pumping voltage Vsp dominates over spin rectification effects, indicating the presence of appreciable spin-to-charge conversion in LSMO films. The spin Hall conductivity is calculated from first principles using density functional theory and the Kubo formalism, and the results qualitatively match with the experimental findings.\n\n[Phys.

While current-density mapping is crucial to studying these issues in situ, nondestructive imaging has been limited to two dimensions. The authors use ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond as nanoscale quantum sensors to probe all three vectorial components of magnetic fields associated with electric currents, for noninvasive imaging of three-dimensional currents in multilayer integrated circuits. Further improvements could reveal the local conductance of materials, to advance condensed matter physics.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 21, 014055] Published Mon Jan 29, 2024",

Kagome spin structure formed by the Mn moments coupled to nontrivial band topology produces giant topological effects in these materials. Mn3Ga with the largest Néel temperature among this class of materials, is potentially useful for high-speed device applications. In this work, authors develop AFM epitaxial Mn3Ga films with controlled crystal orientation, accessing different orientation of Kagome planes formed by Mn moments. Detailed investigations through structural, magnetization, magnetoresistance, DC and terahertz electrical transport reveal the anisotropic transport signatures emerging from the nontrivial band topology.\n\n[Phys.
