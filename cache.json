In this work, the existence of internal gravity wave attractors for rotating stratified fluids is predicted in three-dimensional axisymmetric geometry. This information is used to design experiments using a truncated conical shaped tank in order to form an inertia-gravity waves attractor. We highlight an important difference in the nonlinear regime between the stratification-only and the rotation-only cases.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Fluids 8, 104802] Published Wed Oct 25, 2023",

A negative TMI is interpreted as evidence for quantum information delocalization in chaotic systems. Here, the authors show that a negative TMI can appear in out-of-equilibrium free-fermion models, and it is linked to the presence of entangled multiplets of excitations. Negative TMI signals a weakening of the relationship between entanglement and thermodynamics, which can be understood in a generalized quasiparticle picture framework.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

While previous work has mainly focused on two-dimensional systems, the authors theoretically investigate here emergent phenomena in twisted three-dimensional graphite composed of a misoriented pair of graphite pieces. Despite the twisted interface comprising only a small fraction of the entire structure, it is revealed that the moiré pattern produces interface localized bands, leading to a pronounced Fano resonance in electric conduction.\n\n[Phys.

The authors utilize this effect here to distinguish the antiferromagnetic (AFM) domain state in the noncollinear antiferromagnet TbB4, breaking both the space-inversion (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetries but preserving the combined PT symmetry.

However, the direction of spins generated by a ferromagnet can be easily switched, while that of spins generated by a Rashba system is usually fixed, being set by its electronic structure. This study shows that in SrTiO3-based Rashba interfaces, where multiple electronic bands contribute differently to charge-spin conversion, the application of gate voltage enables a sign change of the charge-spin conversion effect. This offers possibilities for innovative spin-based logic devices.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 20, 044060] Published Tue Oct 24, 2023",

To this end, the authors study the Brownian fluctuations of a nanomechanical beam in a viscous fluid. Their predictions based on elasticity theory, fluid dynamics, and statistical mechanics agree well with their experiments, indicating that the observed fluctuations come with “viscous memory”, but no spatial correlations. The insights from this work are expected to impact the design of nanoelectromechanical systems, cantilevers for atomic force microscopy, and other mechanical sensors.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

To better study these phenomena, it will be crucial to synthesize epitaxial heterostructures for scalability while maintaining high-quality interfaces to preserve the topological surface states and having the Curie temperature (TC) above room temperature. Here, the authors utilize molecular beam epitaxy to tune the TC in heterostructures of van der Waals (vdW) magnet Fe3GeTe2 and topological insulator Bi2Te3 to above room temperature by varying growth conditions. Electron microscopy reveals the existence of thicker vdW compounds in the FemGenTe2 family, as well as some intercalants in between vdW gaps, which are possible origins for the enhanced TC.\n\n[Phys.

The authors demonstrate pseudopotential construction for several atoms and RSH functionals, and find that pseudopotential consistency errors tend to be systematic when computing solid-state properties and can exceed 0.1 eV for band gaps. This work removes the need to incur such unnecessary errors when performing state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations at the computationally demanding RSH-DFT level.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Yet, when ordering breaks a continuous symmetry, excitations at zero momentum cannot really be treated as harmonic, because they correspond to the Goldstone mode that restores the symmetry in finite-size systems. Here, the authors show that zero-momentum excitations can be treated in a fully nonlinear way in terms of a macroscopic spin variable (the rotor): its spectrum reconstructs the so-called Anderson tower of states, a hallmark of continuous-symmetry breaking systems. The rotor variable can be considered as nearly separate from finite-momentum spin waves, leading to a quantitative reconstruction of the low-energy excitation spectrum of finite-size systems.\n\n[Phys.

This has the adverse effect of making integrable and chaotic quantum dynamics appear identical. However, as the authors show here, the humble quantity of global operator entanglement remains a reliable metric of chaoticity in these systems. They elucidate this by studying entanglement phase transitions in a local, non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising model under the lens of operator and quenched entanglement dynamics.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

O. Demokritov, G. de Loubens, and O. Klein\nCombining the nonlinear properties of ferromagnets with the spin-transfer effect promises to realize a “perfect” diode with pure spin conductors. Practical implementations are nonlocal devices that emit and collect magnons between two parallel electrodes on a magnetic insulator. A diode-like current-voltage characteristic appears, which is attributed to nonlinear enhancement of the low-energy magnon population. However, its amplitude is rather small and can be explained by the strong enhancement of magnon-magnon scattering near the diode threshold. This suggests conductance by a magnon fluid instead of a frictionless condensate.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 144410] Published Thu Oct 12, 2023",

Klein\nPractical implementations of diode-like devices with pure spin conductors use magnon transport between two metallic electrodes deposited on a magnetic insulator. However, a diode-like response is only visible for a sufficiently large separation between the two electrodes. The authors attribute this behavior to the contribution of thermal magnons, which respond linearly to excitation and dominate the response for small separations. Their contribution decays rapidly with distance, revealing at large separations the nonlinear behavior that is associated with long-range propagating low-energy magnons.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Such particles are known to get stuck in strong electric fields due to the Wannier-Stark effect. But what will happen with this particle localization if the electric potential is present only on every second site? To answer this question, the authors mimic here the behavior of quantum particles with light in optical waveguides (shown in the image) and demonstrate that in finite systems there are both extended states, carrying the transport, and localized ones that are stuck. This first step opens the possibility to use this system as an encoder of quantum information in a compact way.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, L140202] Published Tue Oct 10, 2023",

It plays a key role in the atmosphere’s dynamics and in stellar interiors. In this study, we built an experiment of penetrative convection in gases which is closer to the geophysical applications. The internal gravity waves field is studied, as well as the growth of the convective layer. In our setup, the convective layer grows quadratically in time which is strikingly different from the 1/2 exponent obtained with classical models and salted water experiments.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Here, a new, experimentally accessible, order parameter is introduced, able to detect time-crystalline phases regardless of the value of p. This unveils a rich landscape with self-similar fractal boundaries in the phase diagram of the long-range kicked Ising model.
