This study focuses on LEV enhancement due to vortex shedding of the median anal fin (AF), utilizing trout’s unique morphology and fin configurations. The shed anal-fin vortex (AFV) is found to stabilize and strengthen the LEV of the CF through its shearing with the CF leading edge, creating stronger leading-edge suction, resulting in stronger thrust production and increased propulsive efficiency in trout-like swimming.\n\n[Phys.

The authors apply machine learning to analyze subresolution fragments in the temporal evolution of the sheet and its bounding rim, ligaments protruding from the rim, and droplets shed by the ligaments. A full accounting includes the further contributions unique to laser-droplet impact: the mass ablated by the laser, and a surprising, centrally located mass remnant.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Here, the authors reveal that the isotope 121,123Sb nuclei with large quadrupole moments are a sensitive local probe to observe the dynamics of orbital degrees of freedom.

Here, the authors comprehensively study these nonreciprocal optical effects resonantly enhanced by electromagnons for multiferroic spin spiral states of perovskite manganites. The giant nonreciprocity observed near the phase boundary demonstrates an important role of anharmonicity of spin excitations for these nonreciprocal effects.

The idea of symmetry has become intrinsically linked with topology described and algebraically characterized by higher categories. Studying three-dimensional systems with noninvertible symmetries, the authors show here that these symmetries are in general incompatible with a unique gapped ground state. Their results extend the ideas behind the Lieb-Shultz-Mattis theorem to the arena of higher-dimensional field theories invariant under a novel class of symmetries.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Finley\nThe spin-valley physics of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) remains one of the main interests in the class of van der Waals materials. At low temperature, it is mainly driven by the electron-hole exchange interaction (EHEI) that describes the annihilation of an exciton in one valley and the creation of an exciton in the time-reversal equivalent valley. Here, the authors show that the EHEI in monolayer TMDs is biaxial strain dependent and, surprisingly, it is an order of magnitude more strain dependent than expected from these first principles calculations. This points to a valley scattering channel that has not been considered in the literature so far.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, L041404] Published Thu Jul 20, 2023",

He predicted the existence of anyons, particles with fractional charge, obeying fractional statistics. The fractional charge was confirmed almost thirty years ago, while the fractional statistics was observed only a few years back. In this paper, the authors focus on yet another fundamental property of the anyons, namely their spin. They derive a “spin-statistics relation” for anyons in fractional quantum Hall states, directly from the microscopic theory. This relation is a generalization of the fundamental “spin-statistics relation” that all ordinary particles obey.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, L041105] Published Tue Jul 18, 2023",

Here quantum systems—in particular the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond—show a path forward, as they can be laser-cooled to a quantum mechanical ground state while a device remains at ambient conditions. By placing an ensemble of N-V centers inside a low-loss microwave cavity in which their spins strongly interact with gigahertz magnetic fields, the cold spins extract more energy than can leak in from the hot environment. The output voltage shows vastly reduced fluctuations at the cavity frequency; the effective temperature is lowered by 150 K.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 20, 014033] Published Mon Jul 17, 2023",

By combining a high-finesse microcavity with an ultrasensitive force sensor (a suspended SiC nanowire), one can reach the regime where a single photon in the cavity has a measurable impact on the nanoresonator. The internal optical resonances of the nanowire strongly structure and possibly enhance the light-nanowire interaction, which can be fine-tuned through careful positioning of the subwavelength-sized nanowire within the standing wave inside the cavity.\n\n[Phys.

In this study, the authors rationalize the antiferroelectric Pbam state of PbZrO3 as a modulated phase, where polarization and antiphase O6 octahedra tilts are coupled via a trilinear gradient term – the so-called rotopolar coupling. A Landau-like continuum Hamiltonian, with gradient terms calculated directly from first principles, gives an accurate description of the energetics and structure of the Pbam phase. Besides reconciling the existing theories on PbZrO3, this study may facilitate the understanding of other modulated structures in perovskites, including ferrielectric and incommensurate phases.\n\n[Phys.

This length-scale reduction offers an opportunity to achieve higher density of quantum information storage, and may open a path to scalable implementations of superconducting quantum processors. However, the smallness of the acoustic wavelength also poses a challenge: It may result in fast qubit decoherence via an unintentional emission of phonons.

This study discusses the classical analogue of the well-known second-quantization formalism, and uses it to analyze a dimerized mechanical chain. The formalism reveals a striking resemblance between the Hamiltonians of the classical dimerized chain and the Kitaev chain, a toy model renowned for bound-state solutions akin to Majorana zero modes. This formulation provides a powerful tool to discover and design classical mechanical mimics of topological quantum systems.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 20, 014019] Published Tue Jul 11, 2023",

The design of high-performance antiferromagnet-based memory and logic devices has been limited by a lack of knowledge about the interaction of AFM solitons with grain boundaries. The authors develop a model of a nanocrystalline AFM material (e.g. magnetoelectric Cr2O3), including proper intergrain exchange.

This provides an elegant explanation of otherwise opaque features of ERG schemes and establishes a clear and intriguing link to information theory. The intuitive picture that emerges is that the coarse-graining of the RG flow produces entropy and this entropy production determines the flow itself.

The former has an easy magnetic axis along the c axis, whereas the latter has an easy magnetic plane within the ab plane. The authors also shed light on the doping effect upon the long-range magnetic order, emergent magnetic phases, and the magnetic entropy consumption in comparison to the parent magnets.

However, TQC grinds to a halt once interactions are included. Here, the authors put forward a framework analogous to TQC, but employing n-particle Green’s function techniques to indicate topology in interacting systems. Fundamentally, they define a class of interacting reference states that generalize the notion of atomic limits, which they call Mott atomic limits.

Nonperturbative excitation drives intra- and interband electron transitions close to the narrow band gaps at the L points of the Brillouin zone, giving rise to pump-probe signals and high-harmonic generation. Preferential excitation in two of the six L valleys generates an anisotropic carrier distribution across the Brillouin zone, causing a hexagonal azimuthal angular dependence of the pump-probe signal. The concomitant symmetry reduction allows excitation of coherent phonon wavepackets along back-folded phonon coordinates.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 107, 245140] Published Wed Jun 28, 2023",

One method uses simultaneous block diagonalization of two generic Hamiltonians to construct symmetry sectors, while another method uses the fact that symmetries in the commutant framework are frustration-free ground states of local superoperators, which leads to efficient algorithms. These methods are applied to conventional on-site symmetries, as well as unconventional symmetries such as Hilbert space fragmentation and quantum many-body scars.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

          "description": "Author(s): H.Y. Yuan, Jikun Xie, and Rembert A. Duine\nThe rise of quantum information science based on hybrid quantum systems bridges different areas of research and provides innovative perspectives on quantum technology. Magnons show great potential as information carriers, but generating robust quantum states of magnons in a scalable hybrid system remains an outstanding challenge. Here the authors consider a superconducting qubit coupled to magnets by the dipole interaction. With delicate frequency detuning between magnet and qubit, an exotic quantum state of magnons is found. Interestingly, magnetic dissipation helps to stabilize the quantum states, which readily involves a wide class of magnetic materials in quantum information.\n\n[Phys. Rev.
