The model accounts for motor kinetics, flagellar deformations, and the hydrodynamics of the suspending fluid. Simulations demonstrate spontaneous oscillations leading to realistic swimming patterns. Notably, the swimming velocity exhibits two distinct peaks as a function of the activity of the molecular motors. These peaks are characterized by distinct waveforms and trajectories. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the biophysical mechanisms involved in sperm locomotion.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Fluids 8, 113102] Published Wed Nov 15, 2023",

Umar\nHeavy-ion fusion is a major research area, and practical approaches to describe the evolution of the nucleon movement across the barrier between the two nuclei are highly relevant for elucidating the essential dynamics of the fusion process. When two nuclei approach each other to distances where the nuclear force becomes active, neutrons and protons could move from one nucleus to the other. This movement could open and facilitate the pathway to fusion. The authors employ a microscopic many-body approach based on the density-constrained time-dependent Hartree-Fock calculations to study the impact of isospin (i.e., proton versus neutron) dynamics on low-energy nuclear fusion along an isotope chain and its dependence on the deformation of the colliding nuclei. In asymmetric systems, iso-vector dynamics plays a significant role. Its typical effect is a reduction in the potential barrier, which turns into enhancement for neutron-rich systems. These effects could be studied at facilities that provide beams of exotic, unstable nuclei.\n\n[Phys. Rev. C 108, L051602] Published Tue Nov 14, 2023",

Here, the authors investigate a prominent example: HHG in GaAs can be enhanced by elliptically polarized light excitation. Remarkably, the enhancement is accompanied by emergent nonlinear optical activity, and it become salient only at particular “intermediate” excitation strengths. These results indicate that the key for HHG enhancement lies in the interference among nonlinear emission processes, revealing that not only material properties but optimal-strength excitations are important for controlling HHG properties via fine-tuning of the nonlinear dynamics.\n\n[Phys.

It does not have a well-defined thermodynamic phase transition, but is typically characterized by a temperature TCDW, below which spatial coherence begins to grow. Using x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy to study an archetypal cuprate, the authors show here that the atomic relaxation dynamics – an inherent, yet hardly explored property in the doped cuprates – is coupled to this change at TCDW.\n\n[Phys.

An analogous law does not exist for compressible flows due to complexities arising from mean property variations and intrinsic compressibility effects, which occur when pressure directly changes the density of fluid elements. By accounting for both these effects, we propose a new velocity scaling that transforms the mean velocity of compressible flows to the incompressible law of the wall. This transformation is more accurate than the state-of-the-art, and is applicable to a wider range of flows.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Fluids 8, L112601] Published Thu Nov 09, 2023",

Neutron diffraction experiments done here find that the crystal structure undergoes a sequence of transitions from tetragonal to incommensurate to orthorhombic, with the latter two exhibiting staggered displacements of the cesium ions. The symmetry of this structure permits antisymmetric exchange, which is consistent with a canted antiferromagnetic structure also observed, and a nice example of a structure-property relationship.\n\n[Phys.

Here, the authors show, in a mechanistic study, that these fluctuations originate from spin-flip scattering mediated by charge puddles via a Kondo-type interaction, an effect which is expected to occur in any narrow-gap quantum spin Hall insulator.\n\n[Phys.

Kaverzin, Ryo Takahashi, and Eiji Saitoh\nExploring low-temperature thermometry, particularly at the micro- to nanoscale, is essential not only for advancing thermoelectric science, but also for the development of quantum technology. The authors present a methodology and an experimental platform based on an on-chip microthermometer, enabling the detection of extremely small temperature changes in thin films, down to tens of nanokelvins. Using this approach, the authors observe the spin Peltier effect (temperature modulation induced by spin current) at 2 K. Their methods have the potential to uncover other low-temperature thermoelectric effects in microdevices, including those made of two-dimensional van der Waals materials.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

This work compares the superconducting and competing charge and bond correlations of the two-dimensional Holstein and optical (SSH) models. The authors find that near half-filling, light SSH (bi)polarons support superconductivity to larger values of e−ph coupling compared to the Holstein polaron. These results are essential for identifying and engineering bipolaronic superconductivity in quantum materials.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 184501] Published Wed Nov 01, 2023",

A milestone here would be observing the fundamental backaction force that occurs when a hybrid mechanical system is optically probed, which can be dominated by classical thermal effects. Using a large ensemble of rare-earth ions in a crystal plus time-resolved tomography, researchers see this backaction as a tiny distortion of the crystal’s surface around a laser beam’s spot, and unambiguously distinguish the photothermal contribution from that of the backaction. Thus rare-earth ions in crystals are confirmed as a promising platform for hybrid optomechanics.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 20, 054004] Published Wed Nov 01, 2023",

In our daily experience, the air doesn’t alter the global outcome of contact formation in the blink of an eye. In this work, we find that the lubricating air film formed beneath an impacting droplet can resist rupture for droplets impacting at a velocity exceeding 1/2 a meter per second; however, beyond a critical impact velocity, contact always occurs from the liquid’s closest approach to the solid surface through the air, at a distance of 20 - 30 nanometers. Below the critical velocity, contact is suppressed for impact upon atomically smooth, cleaved mica, shedding light on the critical phase of liquid-solid contact.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Early studies proposed many-body localization, i.e., strict particle confinement under strong disorder. Here, the authors challenge this notion by highlighting the prevalence of many-body delocalization in a fruit-fly model: the disordered Heisenberg chain. Its relaxation dynamics synchronize over various variables and parameters while adopting the entanglement entropy as an “internal clock”. These results suggest entanglement evolution as a novel temporal measure for a nuanced understanding of relaxation dynamics.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 134204] Published Thu Oct 26, 2023",

Vicente Arche, Sara Varotto, Srijani Mallik, Jean-Philippe Attané, Laurent Vila, Agnès Barthélémy, Nicolas Bergeal, and Manuel Bibes\nRashba interfaces enable spin-charge interconversion via the direct and inverse Edelstein effects, and so may be used to replace ferromagnets as efficient sources and detectors of spin. However, the direction of spins generated by a ferromagnet can be easily switched, while that of spins generated by a Rashba system is usually fixed, being set by its electronic structure. This study shows that in SrTiO3-based Rashba interfaces, where multiple electronic bands contribute differently to charge-spin conversion, the application of gate voltage enables a sign change of the charge-spin conversion effect. This offers possibilities for innovative spin-based logic devices.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 20, 044060] Published Tue Oct 24, 2023",

To this end, the authors study the Brownian fluctuations of a nanomechanical beam in a viscous fluid. Their predictions based on elasticity theory, fluid dynamics, and statistical mechanics agree well with their experiments, indicating that the observed fluctuations come with “viscous memory”, but no spatial correlations. The insights from this work are expected to impact the design of nanoelectromechanical systems, cantilevers for atomic force microscopy, and other mechanical sensors.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Kawakami\nThe heterostructures of 2D magnets and topological insulators are attractive candidates for quantum anomalous hall effect and highly-efficient spin-orbit torque switching. To better study these phenomena, it will be crucial to synthesize epitaxial heterostructures for scalability while maintaining high-quality interfaces to preserve the topological surface states and having the Curie temperature (TC) above room temperature. Here, the authors utilize molecular beam epitaxy to tune the TC in heterostructures of van der Waals (vdW) magnet Fe3GeTe2 and topological insulator Bi2Te3 to above room temperature by varying growth conditions. Electron microscopy reveals the existence of thicker vdW compounds in the FemGenTe2 family, as well as some intercalants in between vdW gaps, which are possible origins for the enhanced TC.\n\n[Phys.

Using real-time tracking, the research covers single and multi-fiber systems. A standout finding is that multiple vertical fibers increase droplet speed but also lead to greater liquid loss in grooves. This discovery is captured in a detailed theoretical model, offering valuable insights for optimizing droplet-based technologies.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Fluids 8, 103601] Published Thu Oct 19, 2023",

Their analysis thus provides important guidance for the challenges in experimentally detecting squeezed magnons through electrical noise measurements.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Yet, when ordering breaks a continuous symmetry, excitations at zero momentum cannot really be treated as harmonic, because they correspond to the Goldstone mode that restores the symmetry in finite-size systems. Here, the authors show that zero-momentum excitations can be treated in a fully nonlinear way in terms of a macroscopic spin variable (the rotor): its spectrum reconstructs the so-called Anderson tower of states, a hallmark of continuous-symmetry breaking systems. The rotor variable can be considered as nearly separate from finite-momentum spin waves, leading to a quantitative reconstruction of the low-energy excitation spectrum of finite-size systems.\n\n[Phys.
