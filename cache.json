Motrunich\nUtilizing the understanding of symmetries in the framework of commutant algebras, the authors introduce here general methods to numerically construct symmetry operators and quantum number sectors. One method uses simultaneous block diagonalization of two generic Hamiltonians to construct symmetry sectors, while another method uses the fact that symmetries in the commutant framework are frustration-free ground states of local superoperators, which leads to efficient algorithms. These methods are applied to conventional on-site symmetries, as well as unconventional symmetries such as Hilbert space fragmentation and quantum many-body scars.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

The authors use this approach to predict inelastic neutron scattering (INS) results on realistic Hamiltonians of hypothetical Kitaev spin-liquid materials.

However, any quantum code utilizing the MIPT can be affected by noise introduced in device fabrication, appearing as static disorder. Leveraging analytics and large-scale simulations, the authors show that this static noise destabilizes the MIPT towards an infinite-randomness critical point.

Marcus\nIntense scrutiny over the last decade of experiments on a variety of platforms aiming to identify topological superconductivity has raised the stakes in this search. Because nontopological Andreev bound states at or near zero energy can resemble topological states, signatures beyond spectroscopy of zero-energy modes are called for. A key signature of a topological phase transition - namely, the closing and reopening of the superconducting gap - is mostly unobserved in previous experiments. Here, this phenomenon is reported in planar Josephson junction devices made from superconductor-semiconductor hybrid materials. Consistency between experiment and numerics, along with a number of other characteristic signatures, including dependence on phase, magnetic field, and chemical potential, support the conclusion that the observed gap closing and reopening, with associated appearance of a zero-bias conductance peaks upon reopening, are associated with topological transition.\n\n[Phys.

The authors introduce here a new purification-based tensor network method for the thermal Hall response of gapped systems, making no prior quasiparticle assumption. Motivated by reports of half-quantized thermal Hall response of Kitaev materials near field-suppressed magnetic order, the authors calculate the thermal Hall response in this parameter regime and find that it is large, but non-universal, ruling out the possibility of a revival of Ising topological order and a Majorana Hall state through this route.\n\n[Phys.

The magnetic properties are governed by strong, local single-ion anisotropy and geometrically frustrated magnetic exchanges. The authors establish multi-k structures at several different magnetic field configurations and model effective exchange parameters using field-dependencies of the magnetic neutron diffraction reflections and the weakly dispersive crystal electric field mode.\n\n[Phys.

In this work the authors focus on the two-nucleon contact interaction at fourth order (N3LO) and use a unitary transformation to reduce the number of involved LECs. This procedure induces a three-nucleon (3N) interaction depending on five unconstrained LECs. Those can be used, in association with a two-nucleon (2N) interaction, to fit very accurate data on polarization observables at low energies, in particular the p-d Ay polarization asymmetry. Thereby, adjusting the induced 3N N3LO LECs can solve the long-standing Ay puzzle.\n\n[Phys. Rev. C 107, L061001] Published Fri Jun 16, 2023",

MacDonald\nSemiconductor moiré materials host generalized Wigner crystal states at a series of fractional fillings, originating from localization of electrons in a subset of moiré sites in order to minimize long-range Coulomb interactions. Using exact diagonalization calculations, this paper studies the interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom that gives rise to different magnetic orders within the crystalline states at fillings ν=1/3 and ν=2/3. The authors provide effective spin model descriptions of those phases, also addressing their Mott-Wigner melting transitions.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 107, 235131] Published Wed Jun 14, 2023",

Here, the authors study small ensembles of two molecular antiferromagnets, {Mn4} and {Co4}, bound to carbon nanotube quantum dots. The current through the quantum dots shows a random telegraph signal caused by transitions between nondegenerate Stot = 0 states of individual molecular antiferromagnets. Statistical analysis shows that transitions between those states are independent in the case of {Co4} ensembles, while {Mn4} ensembles display long-lived coherent superposition involving multiple complexes.\n\n[Phys.

In this study, the authors present novel vanadium-based kagome antimonides that incorporate the chemical flexibility of a rare-earth site, allowing for the intertwining of magnetic and charge degrees of freedom. These new compounds, namely EuV3Sb4 and YbV3Sb4, provide valuable insights into the relatively small LnM3X4 family and open up potential avenues for the realization of additional rare-earth, antimonide-based kagome metals.\n\n[Phys.

However, when we calculate it using structures that are dynamically unstable, results in artificially reduced values and lack of convergence with cell size. By comparing the calculated values with experimental data, the authors can clearly see the importance of using dynamically stable structures for accurate calculations. This comparison also validates the reliability of density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, using a high-throughput approach, the authors perform such calculations to identify new candidates for solar thermochemical hydrogen production among ABO3 perovskite materials, demonstrating the striong influence of B-site cations on the oxygen vacancy formation energy.\n\n[Phys.

Aydil\nYtterbium-doped CsPbCl3 emerges as the primary contender for a quantum cutting coating on silicon solar cells, aiming to enhance both their efficiencies and durability. This is accomplished by converting each incident ultraviolet and blue photon with energies greater than 2.5 eV into two 1.25 eV near-infrared red photons. The potential of this approach lies in the possibility of surpassing the Quessier limit, thereby augmenting the efficiencies of silicon solar cells. While thin films produced through colloidal synthesis and nanocrystal dispersions have demonstrated photoluminescence quantum yields nearing 200%, there has been a growing interest in employing physical vapor deposition as a large-area scalable method due to sub-band gap absorption exhibited by colloidal films. In the present study, the authors made an intriguing discovery regarding the significant influence of post-deposition annealing environment and protocols on the near-infrared photoluminescence quantum yields in Yb-doped halide perovskite films that demonstrate the downconversion of ultraviolet and blue light through quantum cutting.\n\n[Phys.

By microscopically modeling the photoinduced melting and recovery of a charge density wave, the authors instead show here that the transient dynamics can lead to disordered state, where the average order parameter is not representative of the atomic-scale configuration.

We perform a thorough characterization of the effect of the flight stream, combining experimental and numerical data, signal processing, and linear modeling. We show that the flight stream reduces fluctuation energy in a broad region of the frequency-wavenumber space and stabilizes flow structures underpinned by modal and non-modal instability mechanisms. Streaky structures, associated with helical azimuthal wavenumbers and very slow timescales, are the most strongly affected by the flight stream.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Here, the authors study charge tunable devices based on WSe2 and WS2 monolayers. In addition to the well-known radiative recombination of neutral and charged excitons, photoluminescence measurements highlight a weaker intensity optical transition.

The material is highly insulating at low temperatures, preventing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy investigations in the magnetically ordered phase. Theoretically, not only the non-local Coulomb interaction in the low-dimensional compound needs to be addressed properly, but a comparison to the experimental data also requires an approximate handling of the paramagnetic phase. Including these effects gives an excellent understanding of the experimentally observed band structure.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 107, 235107] Published Fri Jun 02, 2023",
