Talley, Serena Eley, Prashun Gorai, Sage R. Bauers, and Andriy Zakutayev\nPerovskite and related materials exhibit a staggering array of interesting ground states and functional applications. Among these, nitride perovskites are predicted to possess intriguing physical properties, but they remain underexplored due to the challenges in synthesizing materials without unintentional oxygen incorporation. LaWN3, recently identified as the first fully nitrided perovskite, displays polar symmetry and a large piezoelectric coefficient. However, its predicted polarization switching (common for ferroelectrics) is hindered by a significant leakage current, necessitating a better understanding of its electronic structure and optical properties. This study delves into the structure and optoelectronic properties of thin film LaWN3 in greater detail, employing combinatorial techniques to establish correlations between properties and cation stoichiometry.\n\n[Phys.

Egger\nCharge transport characteristics in optoelectronic devices play a crucial role in their efficiency. Research over the past decades has established strategies to alter charge transport behavior through material design. However, when atomic motion becomes complex at elevated, application-relevant temperatures, the established structure-property relations are less predictive. In this work, the authors take a major step to solve this critical problem by quantitatively connecting vibrational anharmonicity and dynamic disorder in model anharmonic semiconductors. It is reported that the materials’ correlated behavior determine carrier mobilities and their temperature dependencies in halide perovskites, establishing these phenomena as knobs to tune key optoelectronic properties of important optoelectronic materials.\n\n[Phys.

They show how they are related by different choices of the conformal gauge, reflecting the ambiguity caused by Weyl-invariant pieces.

Harris\nDrag on a sphere in a steady flow is an important and thoroughly studied problem in fluid dynamics, yet relatively little work includes the effects of a free surface. Through experiments and simulations, we characterize the drag on a sphere partially immersed at an air-water interface as a function of submergence depth. The presence of the free surface can induce drag forces several times greater than the equivalent fully submerged case, with pronounced hysteretic effects strongly influenced by the sphere’s wettability. We ascribe the drag increase to an asymmetric pressure loading on the sphere that persists for flows both above and below the minimum capillary-gravity wave speed.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

However, the role of vertex corrections for the pseudogap formation is not well understood. The authors show here that without vertex corrections there is no pseudogap, but an inclusion of even infinitesimally small vertex corrections gives rise to pseudogap behavior. The authors further generalize this statement to a set of boundary models, in which the pseudogap develops upon inclusion of perturbations.

In practice, precise rotation measurements are essential, from magnetometry to inertial navigation to fundamental tests of physics. The ultimate limits for simultaneously measuring all of the components of a rotation are dictated by quantum theory, and here are tested using light’s orbital angular momentum and multiplane light conversion. Rotated states are projected onto a set of coherent states to deduce the rotation parameters, using a method inspired by GPS. The results are near the ultimate limits of quantum precision.\n\n[Phys.

Schoelkopf\nUnderstanding the loss mechanisms in materials is crucial to improving coherence in superconducting quantum circuits. The authors present a technique based on multimode superconducting resonators that distinguishes and quantifies all loss channels in relevant materials. Applying this technique reveals that both chemical etching and diamond turning reduce surface losses in high-purity aluminum, while coating diamond-turned surfaces with thin-film aluminum significantly improves joint quality. This method can be used to design on-chip superconducting devices to characterize microwave losses, as well as to quantify the effects of fabrication processes.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Existing protocols for global-scale quantum communication demand high-performance quantum memories, which have limited communication distance. This study proposes a chain of satellites in low Earth orbit to directly transmit photonic qubits through space, using the satellites like optical lenses to counter diffraction loss. Simulations and analysis of different quantum communication protocols using this relay system show the feasibility of building a global quantum network of only satellites, without requiring quantum memories.\n\n[Phys.

Quantum annealing offers a breakthrough for such challenges in huge search spaces.

We use direct numerical simulation of the turbulence and Lagrangian tracking of the particles. The particles spatial distribution within the flow domain and their translational statistics is shown to depend almost exclusively on the combined effect of inertia and wall roughness, with weak aspect ratio effects. These effects are observed in the particle orientation statistics: Longer particles exhibit a stronger tendency to align with the mean flow direction, especially at low inertia.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Enter ammonium sulfate, a material that holds the promise of effectiveness and affordability within this remarkable realm. Its allure stems from a structural phase transition occurring at 225 K, which can be driven by changing hydrostatic pressure and electric fields. However, because of a large change in volume, cycling crystals through the transition typically results in mechanical failure. In this work, resonant ultrasound spectroscopy reveals the strain relaxation mechanisms responsible for this failure and a thermal pathway by which it can be avoided.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Wilson\nQuasi-one-dimensional materials serve as both testbeds for tractable magnetic models and as a perennial source of intriguing physics. An excellent example is the emergence of multimagnon bound states in ferromagnetic (FM) spin chains, which provide a platform for probing a few-body quantum phenomenon. Despite being studied for many years, the exchange anisotropy-driven bound state of a FM chain has yet to be observed by inelastic neutron scattering (INS). As INS provides a unique window into the nature of magnon-magnon interactions, this represents a substantive gap in the literature. Here, the authors rectify this gap by presenting detailed INS data on the S=½ spin chain Li2CuO2. Their data allows for determination of a refined spin Hamiltonian which fully describes the one-magnon dispersion. With these details in hand, they demonstrate the existence of two-magnon and, potentially, three-magnon bound states in Li2CuO2, with the potential three-magnon bound state showing anomalous behavior.\n\n[Phys.

Coherent quantum dynamics offers the potential for the transfer of information through a linear array of quantum dots almost without dissipation. Here, the authors describe a protocol and calculate the energetic cost of transferring quantum states as a quantum or classical data bus, showing its advantage over the shuttling of electrons and classical data buses.\n\n[Phys.

Here, the authors use static and ultrafast optical dichroism measurements to uncover signatures of electronic nematic order in high quality epitaxially strained thin films of Sr2RuO4. Through the development of a simple Ising model of the nematic order, the authors show that optical pumping induces a coherent oscillation of its amplitude mode. Whether and how this nematic order ultimately influences the superconductivity in Sr2RuO4 remains a key open question.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, L081105] Published Wed Aug 09, 2023",

However, these new measurements suggest contributions in addition to gluon exchange, pointing to the need for further theoretical work and more precise experimental measurements.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

          "description": "Author(s): Valentin Leeb and Johannes Knolle\nThe Fermi surface — the manifold of gapless excitations forming due to Pauli’s famous exclusion principle— determines all electronic properties of metals. In 1952 Lars Onsager discovered how to measure a Fermi surface by studying the response of a metallic material as a function of an applied magnetic field. In fact, observables like electrical resistivity or the magnetization oscillate as a function of inverse field. Onsager’s relation forms the basis for our understanding of electronic properties of metals and is used in many experimental labs around the world. Here, the authors find that, in the presence of strong interactions between electrons, Onsager’s relation can be violated and they provide the first rigorous calculations of this effect. In general, solving for the emergent Landau levels of a strongly interacting material in a magnetic field is a hard problem. The methodological progress made here is enabled by concentrating on an exactly soluble model with infinite-range interactions. This research establishes the importance of inter Landau level interactions for understanding correlated materials in magnetic fields.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 085106] Published Thu Aug 03, 2023",

Diffusion-driven flow is a boundary layer flow due to the combination of gravity and diffusion, existing in density-stratified fluids when gravity is not parallel to the solid boundary. We find that the flow can be either highly oscillatory in space and time, or monotonic depending on the physical parameters. On transient timescales there are situations in which the effective mixing is reduced below the bare molecular diffusivity. Such flows are relevant for applications including solute evolution in rock fissures and also in microfluidics.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Fluids 8, 084501] Published Wed Aug 02, 2023",

          "description": "Author(s): L. Hariasz et al. (KDK Collaboration)\nPotassium-40 (40K) is a long-lived, naturally occurring radioisotope whose decay properties impact geochronology as well as rare-event searches. The KDK Collaboration reports first experimental evidence for the existence of the very rare electron-capture branch from 40K to the ground state of 40Ar, suppressed by two orders of magnitude as compared to the decay to the excited state of 40Ar. This measurement quantifies a previously ill-known background in rare-event searches, resolves a longstanding uncertainty in potassium-based geological age estimates, and benchmarks the theoretical modeling of highly forbidden weak decays including a neutrinoless double-β decay.\n\n[Phys.

In this computational study, a range of techniques from crystal structure prediction to prototype modification, produce an array of low-pressure dynamically stable Lu-N-H phases. None were thermodynamically stable. The best fit to the experimental EOS came from fluorite-type LuH2, while the highest estimated Tc (a meager 17 K) arose from an extremely thermodynamically unstable phase based on 50% N substitution (LuNH)\n\n[Phys.

This poses a limit to the exploitation of BLS to quantify the i-DMI strength in the case of magnetic elements, such as dots and wires, with lateral dimensions below about 400 nm.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Integrating for 2000 s, the resolution here is 8×10−10 m/s2, which is equivalent to the effect produced by a 60-kg person 2 m away. Based on such extremely sensitive and stable gravity measurements, a test of local Lorentz invariance in the gravity sector is performed, where the accuracy of the upper bound on the space-space component is improved by a factor of four—a milestone result in testing fundamental physics with such metrology.\n\n[Phys.
