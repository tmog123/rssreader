It arises from polar distortions of the moleculelike Nb4Se4 and Ta4Se4 clusters, typical for the crystalline lattice of lacunar spinels. Moreover, aside from dipolar relaxations and weak ferroelectric ordering, charge transport governed by in-gap impurity states is found at low temperatures, as previously suggested to explain the resistive switching in these compounds.\n\n[Phys.

The authors combined inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering measurements to study this structural transition. They determined the low-energy phonon dispersions and detected the relevant phonon branch becoming soft. While theoretical calculations broadly agree with the measured dispersion, a clear non-mean-field behavior is demonstrated at this phase transition, which might be connected with quantum criticality and the superconducting dome.\n\n[Phys.

But what kinds of quantum states are efficiently represented by neural networks? To approach this problem, the authors study here entanglement properties of an ensemble of neural network states represented by random restricted Boltzmann machines. Phases with distinct entanglement features are identified and characterized. In particular, the authors show that these neural network states can look typical in their entanglement profile while still being distinguishable from a typical state by their fractal dimensions.\n\n[Phys.

Hertzberg, Oblesh Jinka, Markus Brink, and Baleegh Abdo\nSuperconducting qubits are building blocks for quantum processors, but they suffer from frequency collisions, which hinder the construction of large qubit lattices. This study introduces weakly tunable qubits, whose frequency can be tuned over a small range via external magnetic flux. Through theoretical derivation and experimental demonstration, the authors show that these transmonlike qubits—without losing the desired key properties—can be used to avoid frequency collisions in large qubit systems while minimizing the sensitivity to flux noise. They can also be applied to operate flux-tuned qubit gates.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 18, 034057] Published Thu Sep 22, 2022",

Mizuochi\nQuantum sensing of low-frequency fields is important for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) due to its rich structure and narrow line widths, both at low fields focusing on J couplings and at high fields for down-converted frequencies from conventional NMR. However, the most sensitive and coherent quantum sensing methods work at dc and high-frequency fields only. This study utilizes a quantum oscilloscope approach to bridge this gap. The resulting algorithm has a frequency-independent sensitivity and is able to work in the zero-field region. This approach would have an impact on designing low-frequency measurements where the high sensitivities of quantum sensors are an indispensable treat.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

This saves a considerable amount of computing time over relativistic Hartree-Fock calculations with nonlocal potentials. The PCF-PK1 is obtained by fitting nuclear matter and finite nuclei, including the results of ab-initio calculations; it eliminates spurious shell closures at Z=58 and 92; and it accurately reproduces Gamow-Teller resonances in closed-shell nuclei. This new covariant density functional PCF-PK1 with exchange correlation is expected to provide a unified and consistent description for both nuclear ground states and excited states, in particular for unstable nuclei far from stability.\n\n[Phys.

          "description": "Author(s): M. Schäfer, N. Barnea, and A. Gal\nCharge-symmetry breaking, or CSB, is a fundamental concept in nuclear physics. Adding a Λ hyperon, a sibling of the nucleon with a strange quark, to light nuclei promises new insights as its isospin impurity must impact CSB in mirror hypernuclei, where the only good data available are for A=4. The authors use an ansatz that relates the charge-symmetry-breaking ΛN interaction to the ΛN↔ΣN strong-interaction coupling via the small isospin-one admixture the Λ obtains from the Σ0, as both are members of an SU(3) baryon octet and have an u-d-s quark structure. Once the large CSB observed in mirror hypernuclei Λ4H and Λ4He is reproduced, the deduced isospin-one admixture of the Λ when inside these hypernuclei matches that in free space, provided SU(3) symmetry is partially conserved for these baryons. This approach can be tested in heavier hypernuclei when precise data for CSB become available.\n\n[Phys. Rev. C 106, L031001] Published Tue Sep 20, 2022",

Using a careful DMRG analysis on long cylinders up to width 6, the authors identify here a gapped spin liquid with robust chiral long-range correlations. The analysis unveils the need for surprisingly long systems for the spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking to occur due to strong open boundary effects. This reconciles previous contradictory results about this quantum spin liquid.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 106, 094420] Published Fri Sep 16, 2022",

These applications might benefit from high-dimensional stable deformations under minimal actuation, which known structures have not demonstrated. The authors present a comprehensive dynamical model and experiments based on pressurized strawlike elements, which are lattices of ungrounded unit cells with high-order multistability. These elements can maintain a myriad of complex stable configurations and exhibit complex dynamical transitions—properties that pave the way toward significant engineering advances.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Conventional devices using one transmon qubit exhibit unwanted residual coupling, though, especially at the high detuning that is desirable for suppressing crosstalk errors. To solve this critical problem, the author proposes a tunable coupler based on two transmons that satisfies the ideal conditions of no residual coupling and fast two-qubit gate operations at high detuning. This double-transmon coupler is expected to become standard for superconducting architectures by eliminating unwanted coupling during idle time.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Tensor network methods have entered the arena as a highly competitive, versatile, and well-controlled approach. Here, in particular, the authors use a recently developed hybrid renormalization group thermofield quench approach. With this, they obtain reliable predictions for spintronic transport through a Kondo-correlated quantum dot coupled to magnetic leads in far-from-equilibrium conditions. The work focuses on the effects of the induced exchange field. As a key result, they demonstrate that an additional external magnetic field can be utilized to achieve a full Kondo revival in an out-of-equilibrium setting.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

In this study, we introduce a comprehensive model of shallow water waves generated by the subaerial collapse of a granular column. The proposed model is able to capture the role of the geometry of the collapse as well as the water depth and is successfully compared to a large dataset of experiments.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Lewis, Guifre Vidal, and Alexandre Blais\nQubit measurement is an essential step in any quantum computation. In circuit quantum electrodynamics, a leading quantum computer architecture, qubit readout is commonly one of the longest and lowest-fidelity processes. The authors numerically explore the dynamics of a driven transmon-resonator system under strong, nearly resonant measurement drives to better understand this issue. They find clear signs of transmon “ionization”, in which the qubit escapes its confining potential under the influence of the drive, and semiclassical methods then reveal the mechanism. This approach can be used to optimize circuit parameters, suppress these spurious effects, and increase readout fidelity.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 18, 034031] Published Tue Sep 13, 2022",

Here, the authors return to the classic example of Cu2OSeO3 to tackle a remaining issue: external magnetic field dependence of higher-order modulations. Performing long-exposure small-angle-neutron scattering, a clear difference was observed for the field dependence of the (1 1 0) and (2 0 0) modulations. Comparison to numerical Monte Carlo simulations suggest the appearance of weak swirling spin structures depending on the strength of the external magnetic field.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Using ultrahigh-quality microwave cavities to measure dielectric loss with parts-per-billion precision, the authors clearly show that using silicon is detrimental to qubit coherence time. The loss tangent found here is an order of magnitude worse than previously measured. This study sheds light on the physical mechanisms behind dissipation in silicon, and highlights the need for further work to fully understand the origin of these losses, and how to mitigate them.\n\n[Phys.

So far, spectral coverage of IRQAS systems has been limited to less than 1 µm. This work reports a wavelength-tunable IRQAS system and an efficient measurement scheme to achieve broadband spectroscopy in a short acquisition time. The successful demonstration of rapid spectral measurement over a wide midinfrared window (1.9–5.2 µm) exhibits the great potential of this technique and paves the way for the use of IRQAS in real-world applications.\n\n[Phys.
