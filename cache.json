Armitage, Collin Broholm, and Satoru Nakatsuji\nWeyl semimetals based on Mn3X (X=Sn, Ge, Ga) are promising materials for antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics. Kagome spin structure formed by the Mn moments coupled to nontrivial band topology produces giant topological effects in these materials. Mn3Ga with the largest Néel temperature among this class of materials, is potentially useful for high-speed device applications. In this work, authors develop AFM epitaxial Mn3Ga films with controlled crystal orientation, accessing different orientation of Kagome planes formed by Mn moments. Detailed investigations through structural, magnetization, magnetoresistance, DC and terahertz electrical transport reveal the anisotropic transport signatures emerging from the nontrivial band topology.\n\n[Phys.

The authors extend the maximum strain rate by more than two orders of magnitude. At higher strain rates, their strength estimates show a steep increase that agrees well with extrapolations from some of the data in the literature.

Here, the authors observe a significant THE and investigate its interplay with the spin-polarized topological surface states in a proximity-magnetized topological insulator/ferrimagnet heterostructure. Specifically, they demonstrate a sign change in THE via a top electrical gate as the Fermi level is tuned from the electron-doped to the hole-doped region of the gapped Dirac cone.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Employing the resonant-state expansion and two quasidegenerate modes, they reveal the transformation of the chirality effect on mode splitting from second to first order in the Pasteur parameter (ϰ). This linear effect is demonstrated for individual chiral particles and homogeneous chiral perturbations of metasurfaces.

Blumberg\nIt has been long established that collective charge oscillations of electron density relative to nuclei lattice – the bulk plasmons in metals – are typically unobservable by light scattering spectroscopy. Here, the authors report the unexpected observation of a distinct long-lived plasmon mode in the Raman spectrum of BiTeI, a material with a giant Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In contrast to conventional expectations, the findings reveal strong and direct light scattering by bulk plasmons even in the long-wavelength limit. The authors also establish the basic criteria enabling the discovered observation.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 109, L041111] Published Thu Jan 25, 2024",

Bobbert, Reinder Coehoorn, Feilong Liu, and Guofu Zhou\nDilution of certain disordered organic semiconductors with an inert material can significantly improve current density in devices, but so far the design conditions for a large effect have not been elucidated, hampering application to e.g. OLEDs. In this work, three-dimensional kinetic Monte Carlo simulations are used to study the counterintuitive effect. The results show that dilution is a double-edged sword: The observed effect reflects a balance between a beneficial rise in current density due to reduction of charge traps, and a detrimental fall due to reduction of conducting material in the system. The simulation results are furthermore described well by an analytical model.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 21, 014050] Published Thu Jan 25, 2024",

Also, some qubit types rely on external magnetic fields and require magnetic-field-compatible superconducting parametric amplifiers. Here an innovative amp design leverages the nonlinear response of the gate-tunable kinetic inductance of proximitized semiconducting nanowires. The tunability allows integration with superconducting quantum systems, thanks to minimal crosstalk, and this amp can work with semiconductor-based spin qubits and other hybrid systems in magnetic fields of 500 mT.\n\n[Phys.

MacDonald\nMoiré superlattices give a unique opportunity to investigate controllable quantum systems. Previous studies of transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers mainly focused on magnetic order at half-filling or charge orders at partial fillings. Here, the authors investigate itinerant ferromagnetism in the vicinity of the van Hove singularity of moiré triangular superlattices. From many-body exact diagonalization calculations that shed light on the magnon spectra and the magnetic susceptibility, the Curie temperature is estimated to vary with moiré lattice constant, from a few to a few tens of kelvins.\n\n[Phys.

This work shows that, in analogy to gapless superconductivity, a gapless lasing parametric regime, in which the frequency gap in the fluctuation spectrum is closed, exists for steady-state semiconductor lasers. The gap opens when the laser intensity exceeds a threshold. This gapless-to-gapped transition occurs at a third-order exceptional point.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 109, 045306] Published Tue Jan 23, 2024",

CFs are predicted to form f-wave pairs at the quarter-filled Landau level in wide quantum wells.

Solving and predicting many-body problems exactly is computationally challenging, though, so the approach has remained largely unexplored. This study uses a full configuration-interaction technique combined with atomistic tight-binding calculations to investigate a non-nearest-neighbor exchange-coupling mechanism analogous to superexchange in magnetic materials. This coupling turn out to be less susceptible to charge noise than nearest-neighbor coupling, and so has the potential to reduce local qubit crosstalk and gate densities in silicon-based quantum architectures.\n\n[Phys.

Shelley\nMany biological systems rely on interactions between active processes and passive, deformable structures to properly function. An important example is chromatin in the cell nucleus, where ATP-powered processes, such as transcription or DNA repair, act on the chromatin fiber and influence its motion. Motivated by this system, in this study we develop and analyze a model of a flexible fiber in an active suspension as an analog to a chromatin fiber in an active environment - the nucleoplasm. Interactions between the suspension and the fiber lead to a novel bend instability, and nonlinear simulations identify coherent motions and conformations of the fiber over long timescales.\n\n[Phys.

This paper reports on calculations of yields of Bc+ mesons, consisting of a bottom and a charm quark, in Pb + Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV/nucleon at the LHC. The authors compare the results of their transport model with recent CMS data and attribute the observed enhancement to recombination processes of heavy quarks with large phase-space densities in a quark-gluon plasma.\n\n[Phys.

While traditional microphones are sensitive to pressure variations and have a peak bandwidth of about 200 kHz, the optically trapped microsphere is sensitive to velocity variations and resolves waveforms with frequency content in the megahertz range. Variations of this method could find applications in near-field acoustic metrology for vibrations, surface waves, and small-scale blast waves; in medicine for ultrasonic imaging in proton cancer therapy; and in bubble-chamber searches for dark matter.\n\n[Phys.

Such a structure contains in its active volume nanoscale Ag filaments, which can be used as artificial synapses in neural-network applications. Meanwhile, a fundamentally different type of resistive switching occurs in an atomic wire of pure Ag, where an embedding, ion-hosting environment is absent. This comparative study clarifies the characteristics and origins of the latter, purely atomic switching phenomenon, highlighting its importance in silver-based memristive devices as the active volume approaches truly atomic dimensions.\n\n[Phys.

However, so far there has been no good way to exploit frequency multiplexing in MTJ-based ANNs. To this end, the authors explore changing the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy between a Co-Fe-B free layer and MgO barrier. Their spintronic synapse with adjustable positive and negative weights can classify rf signals with an accuracy exceeding 96%, comparable to that of equivalent software-based neural networks.

This study investigates the mechanisms that create such noise in a thin-film LiNbO3 device. Three distinct noise sources, with unique time constants spanning orders of magnitude, are identified.

The authors study the nonlinear dynamics of doubly-clamped nanoribbons as prototypical graphene resonators. Such ribbons exhibit a thermalized version of Euler buckling, with both up and down local minima. Treating the ribbon as a Brownian particle confined to a double-well potential, they determine transition rates across the two wells and oscillations inside a given well via molecular dynamics simulations. The dynamical behavior found is very different from Arrhenius behavior. The rate-controlling exponential factor depends only on the geometry, as opposed to the temperature, providing a new pathway for the experimental control of thermalized two-dimensional metamaterials.\n\n[Phys.

Despite the good agreement between the measured and calculated Sommerfeld coefficients, the spin-lattice relaxation rate was not captured by the DFT band calculations.

However, the breakdown of the harmonic approximation in a material experiencing a structural phase transition results in large anharmonic deviations that limit the applicability of standard illumination protocols based on periodic drives. In this study, the authors propose a new illumination protocol that enables amplification of vibrations far into the non-linear regime for broken-symmetry materials.\n\n[Phys. Rev.
