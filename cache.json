Fiorillo, Gustavo Marques-Tavares, and Edoardo Vitagliano\nThis study revisits bounds on axion-like particles (ALPs) derived from supernovae, where they may be generated in stellar interiors before decaying to photons. Past works have used observations from SN1987A to exclude ALP masses of 10s of MeV, due to the absence of a signal in the Gamma Ray Spectrometer aboard the Solar Maximum Mission satellite. The present paper argues that such particles would generate a fireball of plasma around the supernova, ultimately leading to a much lower energy photon signal, thus invalidating the old bounds in this scenario. However, the authors find that data from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter can be used to set similar limits.\n\n[Phys. Rev. D 107, 103029] Published Thu May 18, 2023",

The present work provides theoretical calculations on several competing candidate effects that can account for it. The third-order contribution known as the jerk current matches the measured magnitude of the photocurrent as well as its angular distribution. The origin of the large photoresponse is traced back to a constructive interference between the effective mass and the dipole matrix element of the Weyl bands crossing the Fermi level.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

For Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells, antisite defects have long been considered the main recombination centers, yet the underlying mechanism has remained elusive. Here first-principles calculations show that these “killer centers” themselves cannot capture holes efficiently for effective recombination. However, internal conversion to the distorted neutral DX center does open an efficient hole-capture pathway, and DX’s stability in CIGS increases with Ga concentration, which resolves the longstanding issue of why the efficiency of CIGS solar cells decreases at high Ga concentration.\n\n[Phys.

Through multiple state-of-the-art microscopy techniques the authors visualize Ag+ migration in AgBiP2Se6, and how it modulates the interfacial barrier to induce switchable diodelike transport in a device. Illuminating the device can be used to switch off its ionic tunability, expanding its functionality.

          "description": "Author(s): Zhiyu Dong, Andrey V. Chubukov, and Leonid Levitov\nThe recently discovered superconductivity in Bernal bilayer graphene features unique behavior that distinguishes it from conventional superconductors. Firstly, the onset of superconductivity is associated with the emergence of an isospin-polarized phase, driven by Stoner instability. Secondly, the superconductivity is activated by a magnetic field and persists beyond the Pauli limit. These properties have sparked the interest of researchers and prompted the search for a pairing mechanism that can account for these findings.

This work demonstrates that enforcing the piecewise linearity condition leads to robust polaron properties upon variation of the functional. Considered properties include electron densities, lattice bonds, formation energies, hyperfine and superhyperfine parameters, hopping barriers, and transfer rates. This lends justification to the use of efficient semilocal functionals, thus paving the way to accurate and systematic studies of polaronic transport properties from first principles.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Using the AMI equation, the effect of edge Mach number (Ma) and wall-cooling are measured on the turbulent torque that enhances the skin friction coefficient. Moreover, the AMI equation introduces stress-weighted density that yields a more robust collapse of the dataset with different configurations. The MTEI equation distinguishes the impact of Ma and wall-cooling on the turbulent flux of mean kinetic energy and enthalpy, respectively.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

(ATLAS Collaboration\n)\nIn ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions the Lorentz-contracted electromagnetic fields of the nuclei are a source of high-energy quasireal photons which can produce muon pairs via the process γ+γ→μ++μ−. In hadronic Pb+Pb collisions the two leptons in the final state provide a sensitive probe of the quark-gluon plasma created in the Pb+Pb collision or the strong magnetic fields that the plasma generates. This work presents new measurements by the ATLAS collaboration at the LHC of the Pb+Pb collision centrality dependence of the angular decorrelation of muon pairs created via the γγ process. Comparisons of the results to theoretical calculations suggest that the observed decorrelation in more central collisions results from an initial-state broadening of the photon transverse momenta and not from the interaction of the muons with the plasma or its magnetic field.\n\n[Phys.

In this interference technique, performance can be very sensitive to both sample transmission and losses. This study shows that by balancing the nonlinear interferometer’s arms, one can completely recover fringe visibility caused by signal loss. Moreover, intentional unbalancing offers a reduced-interaction regime where the detected power can be 200 times higher than the power reaching the sample, for ultrasensitive midinfrared sensing well below the conventional noise floor.\n\n[Phys.

Here, using high-resolution resonant photoemission, the authors reveal that the intensity of the 4f quasiparticle band in CeCoGe3 exhibits a clear deviation from Kondo-like behavior around the magnetic ordering temperature. The intensity begins to saturate at lower temperatures, coinciding with a change of the magnetic structure.

The hydrodynamic interactions among bubbles in a chain determine its stability. The wake behind each bubble affects the subsequent ones, producing a lift force. For a clean and small bubble, the lift force is destabilizing; when surfactants are present or the bubble size exceeds a certain value, the additional vorticity production on the surface changes the structure of the wake and the sign of the lift force is reversed resulting in a stable chain.\n\n[Phys.

One question that arises is, when are the 4D SCFTs obtained from distinct constructions isomorphic? The authors show in great detail and with a large class of examples that this happens when there exists a “parent” N=(1,0) 6D SCFT. However, there are also some “oddball” candidates of isomorphic theories without a six-dimensional origin.\n\n[Phys. Rev. D 107, 106005] Published Wed May 03, 2023",

Thus little is known about nonequilibrium ODOS properties, although they are important in e.g. solar cells and LEDs. This work presents an optical technique for monitoring the ODOS distribution of relaxed charge carriers at low temperatures. The distribution that forms under nonequilibrium conditions is always narrower than that of the full DOS, in a universal ratio of about 2/3 that is reproduced by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations assuming spatially correlated disorder.\n\n[Phys.

The so-called cobordism conjecture, which is analogous to the conjecture that quantum gravity does not allow for global symmetries, implies that these objects are present in certain type IIB backgrounds, as the authors demonstrate. It is shown that these R7-branes are non-supersymmetric, strings can end on them, and a 3-form field lives on its worldvolume.\n\n[Phys. Rev. D 107, 086015] Published Wed Apr 26, 2023",

The results indicate that the spectral weight below the charge gap of approximately 0.4 eV originates from the impurities and not from the correlation effects. Both the infrared and Raman lines are very narrow, and so too are the Mössbauer spectral lines, which implies a good crystallinity of the sample.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

In this study the authors utilize spinning of the air inside a metamaterial tube to create an acoustic fiber. Their simulations demonstrate nonreciprocal propagation resulting from the acoustic equivalent of the Zeeman effect, which leads to robust waveguiding in the proposed fiber. This contribution may open avenues for studying the physics of acoustic vortex beams and nonreciprocal phenomena.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 19, L041002] Published Wed Apr 26, 2023",

Multiferroic properties interplay via the lattice leading to complex structural behavior with temperature and pressure. Applying hydrostatic pressure to hexagonal HoMnO3 induces a phase transition to a rhombohedrally distorted superstructure, accompanied by disproportionation of Mn(III) and compressibility of the basal plane. These findings reveal new insights into multiferroic manganites under extreme conditions, highlighting the complicated interactions between their properties.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Here, the authors look at the J1-J2 Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice, and calculate the spectral function relevant for neutron scattering experiments. They find a high-energy spectrum consistent with reports of a spinon Fermi surface state in triangular lattice compounds, although the low-energy spectrum rules out such a phase, and points towards a U(1) Dirac spin liquid. They provide clear signatures to look for in future neutron scattering experiments to distinguish these two phases.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 107, 165146] Published Tue Apr 25, 2023",
