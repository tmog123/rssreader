In this article, the properties of respiratory particles, including their number concentrations and size distributions, as well as their formation mechanisms at different sites in the respiratory system, are reviewed. The data in the literature are synthesized via a parametrization of the particle size distribution data using log-normal modes related to the different origin sites.\n\n[Rev. Mod.

This has the adverse effect of making integrable and chaotic quantum dynamics appear identical. However, as the authors show here, the humble quantity of global operator entanglement remains a reliable metric of chaoticity in these systems. They elucidate this by studying entanglement phase transitions in a local, non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising model under the lens of operator and quenched entanglement dynamics.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

O. Demokritov, G. de Loubens, and O. Klein\nCombining the nonlinear properties of ferromagnets with the spin-transfer effect promises to realize a “perfect” diode with pure spin conductors. Practical implementations are nonlocal devices that emit and collect magnons between two parallel electrodes on a magnetic insulator. A diode-like current-voltage characteristic appears, which is attributed to nonlinear enhancement of the low-energy magnon population. However, its amplitude is rather small and can be explained by the strong enhancement of magnon-magnon scattering near the diode threshold. This suggests conductance by a magnon fluid instead of a frictionless condensate.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 144410] Published Thu Oct 12, 2023",

O. Demokritov, G. de Loubens, and O. Klein\nPractical implementations of diode-like devices with pure spin conductors use magnon transport between two metallic electrodes deposited on a magnetic insulator. However, a diode-like response is only visible for a sufficiently large separation between the two electrodes. The authors attribute this behavior to the contribution of thermal magnons, which respond linearly to excitation and dominate the response for small separations. Their contribution decays rapidly with distance, revealing at large separations the nonlinear behavior that is associated with long-range propagating low-energy magnons.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Such particles are known to get stuck in strong electric fields due to the Wannier-Stark effect. But what will happen with this particle localization if the electric potential is present only on every second site? To answer this question, the authors mimic here the behavior of quantum particles with light in optical waveguides (shown in the image) and demonstrate that in finite systems there are both extended states, carrying the transport, and localized ones that are stuck. This first step opens the possibility to use this system as an encoder of quantum information in a compact way.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, L140202] Published Tue Oct 10, 2023",

Moler\nStrontium ruthenate continues to draw considerable scientific interest as an unconventional superconductor. One open question is whether the superconducting order parameter has a single component or two degenerate components. Here, the authors use scanning SQUID microscopy to test for a second superconducting transition in the superfluid density under application of symmetry breaking strain, a key prediction for a system with a two-component order parameter. The reported non-observation of a second superconducting transition constrains future models of unconventional superconductivity in this fascinating material.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

By studying thermal transport in the Heisenberg-Kitaev antiferromagnet and spin liquid candidate Na2Co2TeO6, the authors find here that magnon polarons, i.e., hybridized phonons and magnons produced by spin-lattice coupling, govern the sign and magnitude of the observed signal. This is in contrast to a pure magnon transport theory, which fails to capture important features of the experiment.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, L140402] Published Wed Oct 04, 2023",

Then, near-field flow structures and corresponding noise source analysis are presented based on computational aeroacoustics (CAA) simulations.

The authors demonstrate a reliable, efficient, physics-informed tuning algorithm (PIT) for navigating to a target charge configuration⏤a prerequisite to forming qubits. This tuning method combines machine learning and physical intuition with an algorithm that leverages one-dimensional scans (rays) and conventional peak-finding to navigate from a coarse, unknown device state to a desired charge occupation efficiently and effectively.

Crucial neutrino calibration experiments, however, using intense β-decay sources, yielded rates below that predicted by theory. A recent effort to check the “gallium anomaly” using a more intense source exacerbated the discrepancy. This paper carefully reexamines the nuclear physics of neutrino absorption on 71Ga, slightly reducing but not eliminating the puzzling anomaly.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Within the framework of the generator coordinate method with a Gogny interaction, this paper highlights the important role of hexadecapole deformation in several isotopes of the rare earth region. These features could also have an impact on the evaluation of neutrinoless double-β decay nuclear matrix elements and on heavy ion collision dynamics.

In a first step they compute the energy and particle densities of a nucleus using the Skyrme Kohn-Sham + Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer method. With those sets of data and a deep-learning approach they then train an orbital-free functional. When applied to the 24Mg nucleus, the newly constructed functional successfully reproduces the binding energy of the original Skyrme-EDF, with an accuracy of about 40 keV. The significant computational advantage compared to traditional EDF approaches promises useful alternatives for future applications such as for calculating more complex nuclear shapes in heavy and superheavy nuclei.\n\n[Phys.

          "description": "Author(s): Wanda Hou and Yi-Zhuang You\nThis paper investigates the symmetric mass generation transition in a bilayer honeycomb lattice model using variational Monte Carlo simulations. By measuring the fermion scaling dimension at the critical point, the authors provide evidence for fermion fractionalization into deconfined emergent particles, supporting the hypothesis that the transition is a fermionic deconfined quantum critical point. The numerical results, including the critical exponent and fermion dimension, agree with theoretical predictions.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 125130] Published Wed Sep 20, 2023",

Here, the authors use nanowires of Cd3As2 – a Dirac semimetal – to hunt for these signatures by simultaneously looking at Josephson radiation and Shapiro patterns at different doping levels. By cross-checking the experimental results with an extensive (RCSJ) model that includes thermal noise, it is concluded that trivial supercurrent dominates and that topological supercurrent, if existent, falls below the detection limit of the setup.\n\n[Phys.
