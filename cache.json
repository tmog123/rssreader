Canfield\nIdentification of ambient-temperature ferromagnets is crucial for advancing established and emerging technologies including energy production, memory storage, and spintronics. The authors outline the discovery and basic properties of the compound Cr1+xPt5−xP, the first ternary material in the Cr-Pt-P phase space. Sizable single crystals of Cr1+xPt5−xP are grown from solution by adding Cr into Pt-P based melts. Cr1+xPt5−xP adopts a tetragonal P4/mmm crystal structure composed of CrPt3 slabs that span the ab-plane and that are separated by sheets of P atoms along the c-axis. Cr1+xPt5−xP is a ferromagnetic metal with a high Curie temperature TC = 464.5(5) K and extremely strong planar anisotropy with estimated anisotropy fields HA = 345 kOe and 220 kOe at 1.8 K and 300 K respectively.\n\n[Phys.

Here and in a companion paper [phys_rev_lett_130_xxxxxx_2023], the author demonstrates that the magnitude of the topological protection length can be explained by spin nonconserving Kondo scattering of edge electrons by holes, localized on background acceptors and residing in the band gap. Surprisingly, doping with Mn ions restores the quantization precision due to the formation of acceptor-bound magnetic polarons that destroy the Kondo effect.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

This work focuses on the paradigmatic spin-half chain and shows that there are further simplifications: even static structure factors contain quantitative information about multipartite entanglement at low temperatures.

The defects in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) are known to be metastable: With excitation they change character, which can have a profound impact on device function. The authors show that these metastable defects reduce the efficiency of the solar cell due to an increased diode factor. It is possible to measure this quantity directly from the bare absorber (without needing to build the entire solar cell), yielding a lower limit for the whole device. Experiments and simulations indicate that metastable defects must be reduced to increase efficiency, and not just in CIGS-based solar cells.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

This paper presents a novel calculation of low-density superfluid neutron matter using techniques and interactions previously applied to the study of finite nuclei. The starting point is a two-body interaction softened using renormalization-group techniques. The resulting interaction is used in a Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculation that includes pairing. This provides a good starting point for the many-body perturbation expansion, and for including more sophisticated nuclear interactions in future work.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Here, the authors study x-ray beams with OAM that are created by scattering from a topological defect in an artificial antiferromagnet. Helicity- and polarization-dependent x-ray scattering is used to distinguish two degenerate real-space magnetic configurations of the antiferromagnetic lattice — information that is usually inaccessible in scattering experiments with a Gaussian beam. This demonstrates the potential to use helical x rays for materials characterization.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 107, L060407] Published Wed Feb 15, 2023",

A strong ASOC causes the splitting of the Fermi surface and may lead to unconventional triplet superconductivity or to multiband superconductivity. By combining μSR, NMR, and magnetometry measurements, the authors show here that, despite the strong ASOC, ThIrSi exhibits only nodeless superconductivity, most likely of multiband nature.\n\n[Phys.

Thermodynamically, they can be regarded as interface phases (“complexions”). The authors use atomistic simulations to show that several fcc transition and post-transition metals exhibit the same two grain boundary phases in [111] tilt grain boundaries. This remains true even when using unphysical pair potentials, highlighting that the occurrence of different grain boundary phases is not an exceptional special case, but common across different materials.\n\n[Phys.

In particular, they show that linearly polarized light generates magnon spin shift current that originates from the nontrivial geometry of the magnon band and is closely related to the electronic shift current in semiconductors.

Here, the authors systematically study its properties by using external pressure as a tuning knob. They first find pressure-induced metallization and superconductivity simultaneously occurring at ~3 GPa, presumably owing to a quasi-two-dimensional to three-dimensional structural crossover and to an electronic phase transition due to a change of the bonding nature between layers from weak van der Waals interaction to strong Coulomb coupling. A second distinct superconducting phase is then observed at ~10 GPa due to a structural transition.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 107, 024512] Published Tue Jan 31, 2023",

By combing their experimental measurements with existing high-pressure, high-temperature data on Ta, they can create an experimentally bounded high-temperature equation of state that is valid up to multiterapascal pressures and thousands of degrees kelvin. The equation of state may serve as a useful pressure standard at the extreme compressions and elevated temperatures now achievable in state-of-the-art static compression experiments. This work also provides a clear road map for building an accurate high-temperature equation of state catalogue of materials at extreme conditions.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Meanwhile, the inverse orbital torque (IOT) effect, in which an orbital current creates a charge current, has been difficult to detect. This study uses pumped spin-orbital current in Y3Fe5O12/Pt/CuOx heterostructures to investigate the IOT effect. Mixed spin-orbital states propagate to the Pt/CuOx interface and create a much stronger transverse charge current than that created without the CuOx coating. This inverse orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect can be used to advance applications in spintronics.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 19, 014069] Published Fri Jan 27, 2023",

While one may think that the volume collapse can be associated with conversion of Pb2+ ions to the smaller Pb4+, the spectroscopic measurements in this experiment reveal that the Pb ions remain divalent. Instead, the Cr ions undergo a transition from a charge-disproportionated 2Cr3+/Cr6+ configuration to a homogenous Cr4+ with pressure. Thus, the authors can explain the insulating/metallic nature of PbCrO3 at low/high pressures, respectively.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 107, 024107] Published Thu Jan 26, 2023",

The authors propose here that valuable constraints are implied by the band-filling dependences of the critical temperature and the critical magnetic field, which together define an average Fermi velocity. They show that a robust inverse correlation between the critical temperature and the average Fermi velocity holds in models with band-filling independent pairing interactions. The absence of such an association in experiments suggests that the pairing glue in MATBG is strongly band-filling dependent.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 107, 024509] Published Thu Jan 26, 2023",

Here, the authors use Landau-level spectroscopy to deduce the temperature dependence of the energy band gap in ZrTe5.

Based on the longitudinal coupling, the authors highlight how distant spin-spin coupling and parametrically driven spin readout can be achieved.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Weyl fermions are hedgehogs in reciprocal space, namely, their orbital moments are parallel to their wave vectors. They arise in time reversal invariant semiconductors that feature lack of inversion symmetry. They can be observed in optically active, spatially dispersive media.

The topology of the two domains is characterized by trivial (0) and nontrivial (π) Zak phases, indicating a dimerization-dependent Zak phase. Here, it is demonstrated that pristine Bi also exhibits 0 and π Zak phases depending on the dimerization and develops topological states at antiphase domain walls as a three-dimensional analog of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model.\n\n[Phys.

          "description": "Author(s): Yongjin Sung\nA material’s refractive index is a major input for the light-scattering analysis of microscopic particles and label-free optical imaging of biological tissues. Existing techniques for measuring the refractive index of a nonspherical specimen over a wide wavelength range are typically slow, because they require recording so many orientations and wavelengths of the laser illuminating the specimen. Here researchers demonstrate hyperspectral three-dimensional (3D) refractive-index imaging at high throughput using snapshot optical tomography, which can record a 3D map of the refractive index in a single snapshot, in combination with a wavelength-scanning laser.\n\n[Phys.
