Transitions away from the ground-state subspace, where computations are performed, are detrimental. The authors study the diabatic error which quantifies these transitions as Majorana zero modes are transported across a superconducting wire. Using the ‘piano key’ approach for transport, the authors find that there exists an optimal number of keys which reduces the diabatic error.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 107, 104516] Published Fri Mar 24, 2023",

The authors map quantum Hall edge states along an electrostatically defined potential step in graphene using scanning tunneling microscopy. Tight-binding simulations reproduce the measurements and allow for identifying a parameter range that minimizes the influence of the tip. This enables investigating the edge states while avoiding tip-induced quantum dots within the sample. The image shows a measured edge state featuring the expected antinodal patterns as it meanders along the interface.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 107, 115426] Published Fri Mar 24, 2023",

The results show that whisker sensitivity to gap growth rates gradually decreases when such growth rates become sufficiently high, regardless of initial gaps. From the integrated experimental measurements and theoretical model, the reduction of whisker sensitivity under high gap growth rates can be attributed to sufficiently strong vortices initiated by fast movement of the upstream cylinder, which compensate vortex strength decay due to the gap growth.\n\n[Phys.

This particular class of Anderson transitions has not been well-studied in the past, and the authors fill this gap with a thorough analytical and numerical study of multifractal spectra in the metallic phase and at the critical point of the Anderson transition.\n\n[Phys.

These findings generated interest to understand the interplay between electronic band topology, transport, and magnetism in RX. While neutron scattering is indispensable to fully characterize magnetism, there is very little modern work on this family of compounds. Since the details of the magnetism have a profound impact on the electronic band topology and transport in materials, the authors present here a thorough characterization of the magnetism in HoBi, based on modern neutron scattering techniques.\n\n[Phys.

The authors observe de Haas–van Alphen and Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations in high magnetic fields up to 58 T on GdRu2Si2, which is one of such centrosymmetric skyrmion-hosting magnets with the shortest skyrmion diameter ever found.

This is done with no need to fabricate planar devices; the technique is independent of material platform. Measurements of sapphire in a demonstration of the approach suggest that coherence of superconducting qubits on a common form of sapphire is limited significantly by bulk dielectric loss. The same technique also shows that another form of sapphire would substantially mitigate this bulk dielectric loss and prolong qubit coherence.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

These are formed due to the strain field between graphene and the substrate, and their spatial orientations and shapes arise from minute variations therein. In this work, the authors used low-energy electron microscopy and moire pattern analysis to map out local variations in orientation, strain, and dislocation distribution. This creates a better understanding of the growth process of graphene on silicon carbide (and similar two-dimensional materials) to enable their use in practical applications.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Ksenofontov, H. Rosner, H.-H. Klauss, C. Geibel, and M. Nicklas\nCompeting ground states often lead to the emergence of novel unconventional phases. The presence of magnetic frustration in such materials brings about additional complexity. Here, the authors present a comprehensive study on the ground-state properties of LuFe4Ge2, a ternary intermetallic compound with magnetic frustration and quasi-one-dimensional structure, elucidating the interplay of structure and magnetism. In contrast to the well-studied two-dimensional iron pnictides with competing exchange interactions, LuFe4Ge2 exhibits quasi-one-dimensional chains of geometrically frustrated Fe tetrahedra. It displays a magnetostructural transition at ambient pressure with a change in symmetry from tetragonal to orthorhombic, similar to that in the iron-pnictides, which evolves in an unexpected way under the application of hydrostatic pressure. In that way the intermetallic LuFe4Ge2 material family offers a new perspective on the entanglement of crystal structure and magnetism.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 107, 125136] Published Thu Mar 16, 2023",

The growth is characterized by an effective diffusion coefficient that increases as the substrate temperature decreases and a spherical front that meets the edges of the drop perpendicularly. We compare our model with experimental data for substrate temperature ranging from -9 to -80 °C. We highlight the importance of heat diffusion in the liquid and the adhesion of drops to the substrate that decreases at low temperature.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Fluids 8, 033601] Published Thu Mar 09, 2023",

With the quite unique case of NiBr2, the authors warn about the risk of running into false positives when using the GW+BSE scheme to determine if a system displays negative excitonic energies, which are a signature of an excitonic insulator phase. They show that consistency between approximations used in the ground-state and excited-state calculations as well as independence from the starting point are essential features for a proper description of excitonic insulators.\n\n[Phys.

Contrary to long-held belief, it is recently predicted—but not yet verified—that the allocation of time-dependent flux cannot be arbitrary in the Hamiltonian. This study provides an experimental verification of this prediction by applying fast flux pulses to a fluxonium qubit and taking measurements of the quantum state following the pulses. Given the widespread use of time-dependent flux in experiments with superconducting qubits, verification of this theory is critical to our understanding of circuit quantum electrodynamics.\n\n[Phys.

This study systematically compares density of states of multilayer graphene with different stacking. It identifies tetralayer graphene with rhombohedral (ABCA) stacking as the most promising material for realization of broken-symmetry phases. In-depth analysis of the phase diagram of ABCA graphene shows that, for the accessible range of experimental parameters, the material supports corrugated Fermi surface, which can realize a topological p+ip superconducting state with chiral Majorana edge modes.\n\n[Phys.

Transport measurements reveal its semimetallic nature, which is further confirmed by ab initio calculations on the partially disordered L21 structure, experimentally synthesized by the authors. The most striking feature is theasymmetric magnetoresistance variation with field at room temperature, clearly revealing spin-valve behavior. Disorder-induced ferrimagnetic regions within the ferromagnetic host are proposed to be the reason for this behavior. Simultaneous observation of spin semimetallic and spin valve features makes this alloy quite interesting both from fundamental and applied perspectives.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Sipe\nThe authors derive a semianalytical model describing the reflection and absorption spectra of dipolar bilayer metasurfaces, showing how radiative coupling between the layers can result in the formation of nonradiative dark modes which can contribute significantly to the optical response of the system. The ability to vary the reflection and absorption spectra of such bilayers by changing the material and geometrical parameters, and to selectively excite the modes by adjusting the phase between two counter-propagating normally incident fields, promises numerous applications.\n\n[Phys.

(PHENIX Collaboration)\nThe PHENIX experiment at RHIC presents a measurement of thermal photons emitted from the quark-gluon plasma produced in collisions of Au ions at sNN=39 and 62.4 GeV. The yield of these photons exceeds what is expected from appropriately scaled proton collisions and is qualitatively consistent with a significant thermal contribution. Compared to results from other beam energies, the data suggest that the bulk of thermal photons are emitted under similar conditions near the transition of the quark-gluon plasma to hadronic matter.\n\n[Phys.

Simmons\nEpitaxial atom-based spin qubits in silicon exhibit excellent properties, and benefit from the outstanding scalability of that material platform. As silicon spin-based qubits now start to meet the 99% fault-tolerance threshold, the authors show how the nuclear spins inherent to the local magnetic environment can be engineered as atomic magnets to boost the fidelities of two-qubit logic gates. Modeling indicates that two-qubit CNOT gate fidelities as high as 99.98% are realistic, through silicon purification and careful engineering. This work provides a roadmap for atom qubits in silicon, showing how to optimize two-qubit gates at both the design and measurement stages.\n\n[Phys. Rev.
