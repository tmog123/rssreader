Verstraete\nMagnetic rare-earth orthoferrite perovskites (RFeO3) host a variety of functional properties particularly suitable for next-generation, ultrafast spintronic devices. A key ingredient is the complex magnetic interaction at play between the two magnetic substructures. SmFeO3 has attracted particular interest because of its high-temperature spin reorientation transition and anomalous temperature-dependent lattice vibrational modes. Through first-principles calculations, the authors unveil here the interplay of the Sm-Fe exchange with the strong Sm f anisotropy as the dominant microscopic mechanism, and the nature of the anomalous vibrations.\n\n[Phys.

Hughes\nThe authors introduce here a time-reversal-symmetric analog of the Hopf insulator, dubbed as a spin Hopf insulator. The spin Hopf insulator harbors surface Kane-Mele ℤ2 order and gapless helical hinge modes. Remarkably, the spin Hopf insulator is the first example of a nonmagnetic delicate topological insulator with spin-orbital coupling. In the presence of fourfold rotational symmetry, the spin Hopf insulator also exhibits a returning Thouless pump. These studies of nonmagnetic spin Hopf insulators provide a pathway towards realizing a Hopf material in experiments.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 107, 115159] Published Tue Mar 28, 2023",

Here, the authors study large phase-pure single crystals, obtained via an external gradient method, by susceptibility, specific heat, thermal expansion, neutron scattering, and local μSR and NMR techniques. These find subtle structural changes along with long-range magnetic ordering (1/3,1/3). Large quantum fluctuations reduce the Cu2+ moments, likely as a result of the proximity to a phase boundary in the rich magnetic phase diagram of the model.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

This paper addresses the fate of the plasmon excitation in non-Fermi liquid metals with a sharply defined Fermi surface, but where long-lived single-electron excitations are absent.

The authors map quantum Hall edge states along an electrostatically defined potential step in graphene using scanning tunneling microscopy. Tight-binding simulations reproduce the measurements and allow for identifying a parameter range that minimizes the influence of the tip. This enables investigating the edge states while avoiding tip-induced quantum dots within the sample. The image shows a measured edge state featuring the expected antinodal patterns as it meanders along the interface.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 107, 115426] Published Fri Mar 24, 2023",

The results show that whisker sensitivity to gap growth rates gradually decreases when such growth rates become sufficiently high, regardless of initial gaps. From the integrated experimental measurements and theoretical model, the reduction of whisker sensitivity under high gap growth rates can be attributed to sufficiently strong vortices initiated by fast movement of the upstream cylinder, which compensate vortex strength decay due to the gap growth.\n\n[Phys.

This structure has been properly characterized by the authors in terms of multifractals with continuous spectra of scaling exponents. In this paper, the authors focus on Anderson transitions in systems with a sublattice (chiral) symmetry. This particular class of Anderson transitions has not been well-studied in the past, and the authors fill this gap with a thorough analytical and numerical study of multifractal spectra in the metallic phase and at the critical point of the Anderson transition.\n\n[Phys.

These findings generated interest to understand the interplay between electronic band topology, transport, and magnetism in RX. While neutron scattering is indispensable to fully characterize magnetism, there is very little modern work on this family of compounds. Since the details of the magnetism have a profound impact on the electronic band topology and transport in materials, the authors present here a thorough characterization of the magnetism in HoBi, based on modern neutron scattering techniques.\n\n[Phys.

This is done with no need to fabricate planar devices; the technique is independent of material platform. Measurements of sapphire in a demonstration of the approach suggest that coherence of superconducting qubits on a common form of sapphire is limited significantly by bulk dielectric loss. The same technique also shows that another form of sapphire would substantially mitigate this bulk dielectric loss and prolong qubit coherence.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

These are formed due to the strain field between graphene and the substrate, and their spatial orientations and shapes arise from minute variations therein. In this work, the authors used low-energy electron microscopy and moire pattern analysis to map out local variations in orientation, strain, and dislocation distribution. This creates a better understanding of the growth process of graphene on silicon carbide (and similar two-dimensional materials) to enable their use in practical applications.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

The presence of magnetic frustration in such materials brings about additional complexity. Here, the authors present a comprehensive study on the ground-state properties of LuFe4Ge2, a ternary intermetallic compound with magnetic frustration and quasi-one-dimensional structure, elucidating the interplay of structure and magnetism. In contrast to the well-studied two-dimensional iron pnictides with competing exchange interactions, LuFe4Ge2 exhibits quasi-one-dimensional chains of geometrically frustrated Fe tetrahedra. It displays a magnetostructural transition at ambient pressure with a change in symmetry from tetragonal to orthorhombic, similar to that in the iron-pnictides, which evolves in an unexpected way under the application of hydrostatic pressure. In that way the intermetallic LuFe4Ge2 material family offers a new perspective on the entanglement of crystal structure and magnetism.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 107, 125136] Published Thu Mar 16, 2023",

The authors establish the timescales involved in thermally driven charge transfer, ultimately refuting the assumption of Fermi-level uniformity on the timescales over which optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectroscopy experiments are typically performed for NV centers in diamond.

Using x-ray diffraction, the authors identify the subtle structural displacements associated with this ordering. The displacements are not confined to a single copper-oxygen layer but rather propagate over a surprisingly large distance through the crystal. The authors attribute this effect to the weak c-axis charge screening in cuprates and suggest that this effect could help couple the charge-density wave between adjacent planes in the crystal.\n\n[Phys.

Contrary to long-held belief, it is recently predicted—but not yet verified—that the allocation of time-dependent flux cannot be arbitrary in the Hamiltonian. This study provides an experimental verification of this prediction by applying fast flux pulses to a fluxonium qubit and taking measurements of the quantum state following the pulses. Given the widespread use of time-dependent flux in experiments with superconducting qubits, verification of this theory is critical to our understanding of circuit quantum electrodynamics.\n\n[Phys.

Dasari, Jochen Friedrich, and Roland Nagy\nA distributed quantum network requires versatile and high-fidelity quantum memory nodes, but it remains challenging to make them scalable. This study investigates the use of multiple controllable quantum memories in silicon carbide—an established semiconductor material platform for various quantum technology applications—and provides a viable solution. The authors show that solid-state spins in silicon carbide are ideal quantum memories in a distributed quantum computing network, wherein a controlled generation of highly coherent qubit registers using nuclear spins is possible. This study will impact the future development of quantum networks with solid states spins as quantum memories.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 19, 034026] Published Wed Mar 08, 2023",

The corner shape exhibits a striking universality that is characterized by the radius of curvature and corner angle at the tip, which remains nearly constant over a wide range of flow conditions. Knowledge of the corner angle allows one to determine the global jump shape, as defined by a dimensionless geometry number related to the isoperimetric inequality, thus giving a complete description of the jump shape.\n\n[Phys.

Unfortunately, using such calculations to identify SPTs numerically is notoriously difficult. Here, the authors develop a numerical method mapping this computation to a one-dimensional problem by utilizing the local nature of the quantum circuits that generate any SPT. Its application to models with Ising symmetry fully confirms field-theoretic predictions for their entanglement spectrum. Additionally, nontrivial deformations of the SPT manifest as many-body Aharonov-Bohm fluxes in the entanglement spectrum.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 107, 115113] Published Mon Mar 06, 2023",

Transport measurements reveal its semimetallic nature, which is further confirmed by ab initio calculations on the partially disordered L21 structure, experimentally synthesized by the authors. The most striking feature is theasymmetric magnetoresistance variation with field at room temperature, clearly revealing spin-valve behavior.

          "description": "Author(s): Benjamin Pampel, Simon Holbach, Lisa Hartung, and Omar Valsson\nA common problem in simulations of complex systems is the separation of metastable states by high barriers that hinder transitions between the states. The authors address this by adapting a sampling algorithm that includes a birth-death process, and show that this scheme can efficiently sample energy landscapes with such barriers.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

          "description": "Author(s): Alexander Mook, Rhea Hoyer, Jelena Klinovaja, and Daniel Loss\nThe fully polarized ferromagnetic ground state is arguably the least quantum of all magnetic ground states. Nonetheless, the authors show that it can support topological quantum spin excitations with exotic spin-multipolar properties if spin conservation is broken. These excitations are superpositions of dipolar magnons and quadrupolar two-magnon bound states. As a result of their topology, such quantum ferromagnets exhibit both chiral edge excitations, akin to edge states in Chern insulators but at finite energy, and an intrinsic thermal Hall effect.\n\n[Phys.
