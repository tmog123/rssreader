          "description": "Author(s): Han Zhang (张菡) and Robert A. Riggleman\nUnderstanding the relationship between the macroscopic behaviors of polymer networks and their molecular structures is a challenging and long-standing problem in polymer physics and soft matter research. Combining molecular dynamics simulations and network analysis techniques, this study sheds light on the topological and geometric features governing the fracture process of model end-linked polymer networks. Geodesic edge betweenness centrality, local defect concentration and the orientation of network strands, extracted from the initial undeformed network conformations, are found to be served as effective predictors for identifying failure locations under uniaxial deformation. This work demonstrates the potential of a universal approach utilizing network analysis tools to address outstanding questions in soft matter society and to design the next generation of network materials with exceptional properties.\n\n[Phys.

Among them are a commensurate magnetization plateau, a longitudinal spin density wave, and an incommensurate spin-fan structure. Even more unusual is the excitation spectrum. It is an hierarchy of successive bound states of fractional kink quasiparticles. To understand this rich physics, one has to know the spin Hamiltonian, and that can only be determined in high-field spectroscopic measurements.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

We investigate the bias using large-eddy simulations of free convection configured for the ocean, but the idealization of our simulations makes the results more broadly relevant to a wide range of flows. We propose a theory that the addition of many small convective vortices, each of which exhibit a small bias, leads to a much more significant bias for large convective vortices. We apply this new theory to typical convective conditions in the ocean and the terrestrial and Martian atmospheres.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Fluids 9, 033503] Published Tue Mar 26, 2024",

The problem is shown to arise because dynamical mean field theory relies on a local self-energy approximation that is invalidated by scattering kinematics in low-density systems. The results indicate that recent calculations of scattering rates and conductivity in Weyl metals should be reexamined.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 109, 115154] Published Tue Mar 26, 2024",

However, a recent study challenged this view by discovering a substantial band gap in this system. Here, the authors successfully synthesize highly insulating EuCd2As2. It reveals a decrease of the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) by orders of magnitude as the carrier density decreases, contradicting the expected behavior of intrinsic AHC generated by the Weyl points.

          "description": "Author(s): A. Ashtari Esfahani et al. (Project 8 Collaboration)\nNeutrino mass is a key parameter in nuclear and particle physics and in cosmology. The Project 8 Collaboration developed an innovative method with potential to improve the current mass limits by more than an order of magnitude. Announced in a paper published last September (PRL 131, 102502; see also the Synopsis at https://physics.aps.org/articles/v16/s121), the method measures the frequency of radiation from tritium β-decay electrons spiraling in a magnetic field. In the current paper the authors provide the details of this unique measurement technique including the hardware and the role of simulations and precision spectroscopy that enabled their new direct mass measurement. This first, small-volume demonstration, along with the precision reached, shows a clear path to improve in future experiments on the conservative upper limit for the neutrino mass obtained here.\n\n[Phys.

The model reveals that flow reversals can be achieved when turbulent fluctuations drive the LSC azimuthal diffusion into a flow state such that the two LSC planes are orthogonal to each other, the strength of the LSC in the high Rayleigh number fluid layer then reduces to zero deterministically.

However, historical measurements show insulating electrical transport. The authors use single-crystal diffraction and transmission electron microscopy to show that large single crystals have pristine chirality: they can exhibit a single enantiomer over millimeters. They resolve the contradiction in transport by showing a consistent iodine deficiency of more than 10%. These vacancies produce structural modulations visible in diffuse scattering and represent a new competing interaction in a class of materials with fragile electronic states.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

However, in magnetic heterostructures, the efficiency of converting spins into charges is not always equivalent to converting charges into spins. This study intends to explain this discrepancy by accounting for both interfacial and bulk spin-orbit coupling. It shows that the charge-to-spin conversion is highly sensitive to spin current leakage, whereas spin-to-charge conversion is less affected by it. As a result, spin pumping appears as a more robust process than spin-orbit torque to quantify spin-charge interconversion efficiencies.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 109, 094424] Published Tue Mar 19, 2024",

In this work the authors extend to heavier nuclei a highly predictive microscopic approach based on ab-initio self-consistent Green’s function (SCGF) calculations that use NN and 3N chiral interactions as the only input. The computed elastic proton scattering off Ca and Ni isotope chains demonstrate the stability of the SCGF input, a method that requires only polynomial scaling of computational resources and reaches masses up to 140 nucleons or more.

Using mean field theory and DMRG, they find that this leads to the formation of two novel valence bond solid phases with a rich topological phase diagram and protected edge modes.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Previously, such surface control relied on aggressive treatments, such as annealing, plasma exposure, or strong acids, but here the authors demonstrate a novel technique utilizing a laser under ambient conditions. This technique is demonstrated on NV and SiV centers, with optical spatial resolution and continuous optical feedback.

The method is applied to the Si-Ge binary alloy and is used to analyze phase stability under arbitrary epitaxial constraints.

In one-dimensional systems at finite temperature, ordered phases are generally excluded. Consequently, although symmetry-protected topological order may be present at zero temperature, its emergence at late times is not expected. This paper uncovers a mechanism that allows symmetry-protected topological order to emerge away from equilibrium for arbitrarily long times. It is based on the existence of hidden (semilocal) symmetries associated with operators that represent local observables only in a symmetry-restricted Hilbert space.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Here, the authors report the finding of comparable thermal Hall ratios in a series of charge-compensated topological insulators and discuss this observation in the context of a recent proposal that a thermal Hall effect can result from skew scattering of phonons on charged defects.\n\n[Phys.

Through first-principles studies, the authors show here that significant charge transfer occurs at the Bi2Se3/BiSe/transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructure interfaces that stabilizes the BiSe layer as an electron donor and the resulting dipole field breaks the inversion symmetry of the Bi2Se3 layer. This results in giant Rashba band splitting and the reemergence of the Dirac states in thin Bi2Se3 layers.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 109, 115112] Published Fri Mar 08, 2024",

The characteristic spectral and temporal features of this recombination highlight the asymmetric electric field distribution on either side of the 2DHG. The effects of this electric field are discussed, particularly regarding their implications for optical recombination mechanisms within the heterostructure.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

However, up to now, the focus has been on planar YIG thin films owing to the challenges associated with manufacturing non-planar structures. Here, the authors demonstrate the fabrication of single crystalline YIG via lateral solid phase epitaxy on top of an artificially defined SiOx mesa over micrometer length scales. The reported results lay the foundation for the development of non-planar, epitaxial YIG thin films as well as free standing YIG structures, while still maintaining complete control over the crystal orientation.\n\n[Phys.

The network leverages complete/sparse fields of velocity components as physical constraints and adopts a PatchGAN discriminator network. The proposed reconstruction framework has been shown to achieve excellent reconstruction performance. The reconstructed flow fields are consistent with the raw flow fields in terms of magnitude, power spectrum, and two-point correlation function.\n\n[Phys. Rev.
