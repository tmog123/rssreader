Here, the authors study the consequences of such coupling in polar metals, where one of the polar phonons has undergone a symmetry-breaking transition. They show that application of magnetic field reveals a spectrum of collective modes that can change their character (electronic vs. lattice) and energy as a function of field strength. Optical spectroscopy experiments are shown to have the capability to probe these modes.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 075162] Published Mon Aug 28, 2023",

Kawasaki\nBismuth-containing half-Heusler compounds were among the first identified Weyl semimetals. However, it remains a question whether other half-Heuslers also exhibit Weyl physics. Additionally, the impacts of point defects on the transport properties of Weyl semimetals are often overlooked. One experimental signature of Weyl nodes is the chiral anomaly, which involves charge pumping between Weyl nodes in reciprocal space. In this study, the authors demonstrate that naturally occurring Pt vacancies in GdPtxSb epitaxial films complicate the identification of the chiral anomaly through magnetotransport measurements. On the other hand, they observe signatures of the topological Hall effect, indicating the presence of chiral spin textures in real space.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Magnetoelectric powder samples are alternatives to magnetic topological insulators which, in practice, are not suitable candidates. Here, the authors experimentally and theoretically investigate the magnetoelectric susceptibility of Cr2O3 powder. Although electric and magnetic field cooling tunes the susceptibility, there is no field-cooling protocol that leads to a pure monopole response. These insights provide alternatives to realize effective magnetoelectric monopole media.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 054437] Published Fri Aug 25, 2023",

Electron and hole-doped shandite films are systematically studied to map the evolution of Hall conductivities against Fermi level tuning.

The authors propose a solution using hardware native to quantum networking. This quantum-time-transfer technique can quickly achieve picosecond-level clock synchronization despite relatively low-performance quantum-photon sources and detection equipment. Furthermore, it is robust against the high loss and high noise channel conditions representative of daytime space-Earth links, and could provide high-precision secure timing in GPS-denied environments.\n\n[Phys.

Talley, Serena Eley, Prashun Gorai, Sage R. Bauers, and Andriy Zakutayev\nPerovskite and related materials exhibit a staggering array of interesting ground states and functional applications. Among these, nitride perovskites are predicted to possess intriguing physical properties, but they remain underexplored due to the challenges in synthesizing materials without unintentional oxygen incorporation. LaWN3, recently identified as the first fully nitrided perovskite, displays polar symmetry and a large piezoelectric coefficient. However, its predicted polarization switching (common for ferroelectrics) is hindered by a significant leakage current, necessitating a better understanding of its electronic structure and optical properties. This study delves into the structure and optoelectronic properties of thin film LaWN3 in greater detail, employing combinatorial techniques to establish correlations between properties and cation stoichiometry.\n\n[Phys.

Egger\nCharge transport characteristics in optoelectronic devices play a crucial role in their efficiency. Research over the past decades has established strategies to alter charge transport behavior through material design. However, when atomic motion becomes complex at elevated, application-relevant temperatures, the established structure-property relations are less predictive. In this work, the authors take a major step to solve this critical problem by quantitatively connecting vibrational anharmonicity and dynamic disorder in model anharmonic semiconductors. It is reported that the materials’ correlated behavior determine carrier mobilities and their temperature dependencies in halide perovskites, establishing these phenomena as knobs to tune key optoelectronic properties of important optoelectronic materials.\n\n[Phys.

Through experiments and simulations, we characterize the drag on a sphere partially immersed at an air-water interface as a function of submergence depth. The presence of the free surface can induce drag forces several times greater than the equivalent fully submerged case, with pronounced hysteretic effects strongly influenced by the sphere’s wettability. We ascribe the drag increase to an asymmetric pressure loading on the sphere that persists for flows both above and below the minimum capillary-gravity wave speed.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

The ultimate limits for simultaneously measuring all of the components of a rotation are dictated by quantum theory, and here are tested using light’s orbital angular momentum and multiplane light conversion.

This method can be used to design on-chip superconducting devices to characterize microwave losses, as well as to quantify the effects of fabrication processes.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Existing protocols for global-scale quantum communication demand high-performance quantum memories, which have limited communication distance. This study proposes a chain of satellites in low Earth orbit to directly transmit photonic qubits through space, using the satellites like optical lenses to counter diffraction loss. Simulations and analysis of different quantum communication protocols using this relay system show the feasibility of building a global quantum network of only satellites, without requiring quantum memories.\n\n[Phys.

Quantum annealing offers a breakthrough for such challenges in huge search spaces. The authors propose a combination of quantum annealing, machine learning, and first-principles calculations that is computationally cheaper than ordinary machine learning in designing atomically disordered spinel oxides (promising materials for magnetoresistive devices).

We use direct numerical simulation of the turbulence and Lagrangian tracking of the particles. The particles spatial distribution within the flow domain and their translational statistics is shown to depend almost exclusively on the combined effect of inertia and wall roughness, with weak aspect ratio effects. These effects are observed in the particle orientation statistics: Longer particles exhibit a stronger tendency to align with the mean flow direction, especially at low inertia.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Enter ammonium sulfate, a material that holds the promise of effectiveness and affordability within this remarkable realm. Its allure stems from a structural phase transition occurring at 225 K, which can be driven by changing hydrostatic pressure and electric fields. However, because of a large change in volume, cycling crystals through the transition typically results in mechanical failure. In this work, resonant ultrasound spectroscopy reveals the strain relaxation mechanisms responsible for this failure and a thermal pathway by which it can be avoided.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Wilson\nQuasi-one-dimensional materials serve as both testbeds for tractable magnetic models and as a perennial source of intriguing physics. An excellent example is the emergence of multimagnon bound states in ferromagnetic (FM) spin chains, which provide a platform for probing a few-body quantum phenomenon. Despite being studied for many years, the exchange anisotropy-driven bound state of a FM chain has yet to be observed by inelastic neutron scattering (INS). As INS provides a unique window into the nature of magnon-magnon interactions, this represents a substantive gap in the literature. Here, the authors rectify this gap by presenting detailed INS data on the S=½ spin chain Li2CuO2. Their data allows for determination of a refined spin Hamiltonian which fully describes the one-magnon dispersion. With these details in hand, they demonstrate the existence of two-magnon and, potentially, three-magnon bound states in Li2CuO2, with the potential three-magnon bound state showing anomalous behavior.\n\n[Phys.

Here, the authors describe a protocol and calculate the energetic cost of transferring quantum states as a quantum or classical data bus, showing its advantage over the shuttling of electrons and classical data buses.\n\n[Phys.

Harter\nThe nature of unconventional superconductivity in Sr2RuO4 remains stubbornly unresolved, and it is clear that a fundamental piece of the puzzle is still missing. Here, the authors use static and ultrafast optical dichroism measurements to uncover signatures of electronic nematic order in high quality epitaxially strained thin films of Sr2RuO4. Through the development of a simple Ising model of the nematic order, the authors show that optical pumping induces a coherent oscillation of its amplitude mode. Whether and how this nematic order ultimately influences the superconductivity in Sr2RuO4 remains a key open question.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, L081105] Published Wed Aug 09, 2023",

Johnson\nThe authors show here that the introduction of substitutional disorder in the presence of competing exchange interactions causes the [Y2−xMnx]Mn6O12 quadruple perovskite manganites to develop short-range antiferromagnetic clusters contained in a paramagnetic matrix, before transitioning to a phase characterized by well correlated long-range ferrimagnetic order that coexists with the short-range antiferromagnetic clusters. It is spin doping through the substitution of magnetic Mn ions for nonmagnetic Y ions that gives rise to a spin texture that is inhomogeneous on the nanoscale.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

          "description": "Author(s): Valentin Leeb and Johannes Knolle\nThe Fermi surface — the manifold of gapless excitations forming due to Pauli’s famous exclusion principle— determines all electronic properties of metals. In 1952 Lars Onsager discovered how to measure a Fermi surface by studying the response of a metallic material as a function of an applied magnetic field. In fact, observables like electrical resistivity or the magnetization oscillate as a function of inverse field. Onsager’s relation forms the basis for our understanding of electronic properties of metals and is used in many experimental labs around the world. Here, the authors find that, in the presence of strong interactions between electrons, Onsager’s relation can be violated and they provide the first rigorous calculations of this effect. In general, solving for the emergent Landau levels of a strongly interacting material in a magnetic field is a hard problem. The methodological progress made here is enabled by concentrating on an exactly soluble model with infinite-range interactions. This research establishes the importance of inter Landau level interactions for understanding correlated materials in magnetic fields.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 085106] Published Thu Aug 03, 2023",

Diffusion-driven flow is a boundary layer flow due to the combination of gravity and diffusion, existing in density-stratified fluids when gravity is not parallel to the solid boundary. We find that the flow can be either highly oscillatory in space and time, or monotonic depending on the physical parameters. On transient timescales there are situations in which the effective mixing is reduced below the bare molecular diffusivity. Such flows are relevant for applications including solute evolution in rock fissures and also in microfluidics.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Fluids 8, 084501] Published Wed Aug 02, 2023",

Here, the author investigates the orbital angular momentum induced spin splitting of surface states on Au(110) by first-principles calculations. It is revealed that although the p component of the orbital angular momentum is much smaller than the d component, the former gives rise to a large anisotropy in the orientation dependence of spin-splitting energies. This is because the spin-orbit coupling parameter for the p orbital of Au is several times larger than that for the d orbital.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 085401] Published Wed Aug 02, 2023",
