Magnetic nitrogen-rich compounds generally remain underexplored, despite the unique chemical bonding afforded by the N3− ion with open d-shell transition metals. Here, the authors explore the compound MnSiN2 where Mn2+ ions reside on a 3D diamond-like covalent network with strong magnetic superexchange pathways. The compound exhibits a high Néel ordering temperature of TN = 443 K and the precise canted ground state magnetic structure is resolved using a combination of DFT modeling and powder neutron diffraction.\n\n[Phys.

Yet, when ordering breaks a continuous symmetry, excitations at zero momentum cannot really be treated as harmonic, because they correspond to the Goldstone mode that restores the symmetry in finite-size systems. Here, the authors show that zero-momentum excitations can be treated in a fully nonlinear way in terms of a macroscopic spin variable (the rotor): its spectrum reconstructs the so-called Anderson tower of states, a hallmark of continuous-symmetry breaking systems. The rotor variable can be considered as nearly separate from finite-momentum spin waves, leading to a quantitative reconstruction of the low-energy excitation spectrum of finite-size systems.\n\n[Phys.

These findings offer a fresh perspective on phase diagrams, including a precise description of the M1-M1′ isostructural transition occurring at a staggering 14 GPa. The study also reveals that isothermal compression at 298 K drives a thrilling journey close to the critical point. The authors present the first Raman signature of the elusive metallic X-phase, observed at pressures exceeding 32 GPa.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 144106] Published Mon Oct 16, 2023",

The authors show the potentials of the combination of skyrmions with nanoring geometry, by proposing three energy-efficient nanoscale devices: A skyrmion clock with a tunable frequency, a skyrmion alternator where the skyrmion motion is converted into an electrical signal (potentially at μV), and a skyrmion energy harvester to partially recover dissipated heat into electrical energy. This work will stimulate further development in this exciting research direction.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 20, 044039] Published Mon Oct 16, 2023",

The authors experimentally demonstrate a programmable three-dimensional photonic processor capable of solving the maximum clique problem by encoding injection conditions of photons. The prototype shows the potential of photonic computing, and is applied to solve molecular docking problems. The combination of non-von Neumann parallel computing architectures with fully programmable capabilities paves the way for wider practical applications and photonic computational advantages.\n\n[Phys.

          "description": "Author(s): Brian Barch, Namit Anand, Jeffrey Marshall, Eleanor Rieffel, and Paolo Zanardi\nIn weakly monitored quantum systems, traditional diagnostics of operator spreading such as out-of-time-ordered-correlators and Lieb-Robinson bounds can break down, as entanglement can spread at seemingly unbounded velocity. This has the adverse effect of making integrable and chaotic quantum dynamics appear identical. However, as the authors show here, the humble quantity of global operator entanglement remains a reliable metric of chaoticity in these systems. They elucidate this by studying entanglement phase transitions in a local, non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising model under the lens of operator and quenched entanglement dynamics.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

O. Demokritov, G. de Loubens, and O. Klein\nCombining the nonlinear properties of ferromagnets with the spin-transfer effect promises to realize a “perfect” diode with pure spin conductors. Practical implementations are nonlocal devices that emit and collect magnons between two parallel electrodes on a magnetic insulator. A diode-like current-voltage characteristic appears, which is attributed to nonlinear enhancement of the low-energy magnon population. However, its amplitude is rather small and can be explained by the strong enhancement of magnon-magnon scattering near the diode threshold. This suggests conductance by a magnon fluid instead of a frictionless condensate.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 144410] Published Thu Oct 12, 2023",

Klein\nPractical implementations of diode-like devices with pure spin conductors use magnon transport between two metallic electrodes deposited on a magnetic insulator. However, a diode-like response is only visible for a sufficiently large separation between the two electrodes. The authors attribute this behavior to the contribution of thermal magnons, which respond linearly to excitation and dominate the response for small separations. Their contribution decays rapidly with distance, revealing at large separations the nonlinear behavior that is associated with long-range propagating low-energy magnons.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Epitaxial thin films of PdYBi and PtYBi are successfully prepared and demonstrated to exhibit nontrivial topology. Characterization of the magnetotransport in a model device shows that these half-Heusler films can outperform platinum in spin-to-charge interconversion.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Such particles are known to get stuck in strong electric fields due to the Wannier-Stark effect. But what will happen with this particle localization if the electric potential is present only on every second site? To answer this question, the authors mimic here the behavior of quantum particles with light in optical waveguides (shown in the image) and demonstrate that in finite systems there are both extended states, carrying the transport, and localized ones that are stuck. This first step opens the possibility to use this system as an encoder of quantum information in a compact way.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, L140202] Published Tue Oct 10, 2023",

The velocity fields are reconstructed with the Biot-Savart law applied to the vorticity vectors of shear and rigid-body rotation. The key image shows a mean flow pattern of small-scale shear layers in isotropic turbulence. The velocity associated with the shear layers dominates the turbulent kinetic energy budget, scalar transport, and energy cascade in isotropic turbulence and planar jets.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

This unveils a rich landscape with self-similar fractal boundaries in the phase diagram of the long-range kicked Ising model.

An efficient optimization comparable to back propagation is established, enabling competitive performance in challenging machine-learning benchmarks.
