Schultheiss\nSpintronic devices have attracted strong interest in neuromorphic computing, because of their inherent nonlinear behavior and synchronization capabilities. To build magnon-based networks between spintronic oscillators acting as neurons, control mechanisms are the key to adjusting their interactions. This study uses spin-orbit torque to reduce damping and enable magnon scattering in ultrathin waveguides. Microwave power and frequency, as well as spin-current magnitude, can be used as control parameters for nonlinear generation of additional magnon modes at distinct frequencies. Field-dependent time- and space-resolved measurements expose the underlying physical process.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 20, 014062] Published Thu Jul 27, 2023",

In this work, a novel growth approach to grow grain-boundary-free Al on a lattice-mismatched InAs quantum well is introduced. More specifically, a monocrystalline Al phase is achieved by intentional roughening of the semiconductor surface. This approach can in general be applied to other mismatched material systems where a high degree of crystallinity is essential. Furthermore, the authors investigate the altered interfaces in transport measurements, hoping to shed more light upon the pressing question: “What is the role of the detailed crystallography of the SC for the performance of SE/SC hybrid devices?”\n\n[Phys.

This work reports an experimental exploration of RhSb3, a symmorphic cubic unfilled skutterudite compound that was predicted to host a quasi-linear electronic band dispersion long before the topological revolution. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, magnetotransport, and quantum oscillation measurements are used to confirm this material family to host a symmetry-enforced Fermi degeneracy, complete with nonzero Berry phase and location of the Fermi energy in the linear regime of the system’s valence band.\n\n[Phys.

However, relatively few materials realize an interacting spin network that is topologically equivalent to the SS model. In this work, researchers have expanded the material space with a foundational study of single crystalline BaNd2PtO5, which contains an effective SS lattice of Nd moments. A complex three-dimensional magnetic structure was observed via neutron single crystal diffraction. This spin structure is associated with a large magnetic anisotropy and a particularly strong sensitivity of the magnetization to the crystal orientation. These results offer an interesting new candidate for studying the physics associated with the SS model and establish a high sensitivity to crystal orientation as a guide when studying related materials.\n\n[Phys.

Here, the authors study the temperature evolution of the Dirac band in ZrTe5 and find no indication of band-gap closure as temperature changes. They show that a weak topological insulator phase across the temperature range may not be the only explanation. A topological phase transition is still possible if the band mixing and inversion are considered.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, L041202] Published Wed Jul 26, 2023",

Typically studied in a confined cylindrical geometry, it was found in recent years that in such confined set-ups, a strong flow structure can develop near the side wall, obscuring observations of the bulk dynamics that we are interested in. Here we study different properties of this wall bounded flow, focussing on the interaction between the bulk and side wall region, to advance our understanding of how to disentangle the two.\n\n[Phys.

Here, the AFD phonon mode is studied using inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS), combined with a computational approach including anharmonicity. Both classical molecular dynamics (MD) and a self-consistent phonon approach are used, the latter including quantum fluctuations of the atomic motion.

In this study, modeling shows that a two-pronged approach enables a thermal switch with two tuning “knobs”: a magnetocaloric knob to tune the temperature gradient, and a magneto-optical knob to fine-tune the effective thermal resistance. This enables additional modes of operation, such as reversing the flow of heat. This work highlights the utility of combining various “-caloric” effects with complementary modes of heat transfer for fresh ways of controlling thermal energy.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

The shed anal-fin vortex (AFV) is found to stabilize and strengthen the LEV of the CF through its shearing with the CF leading edge, creating stronger leading-edge suction, resulting in stronger thrust production and increased propulsive efficiency in trout-like swimming.\n\n[Phys.

In this paper, Højlund, Grovn and coworkers derive a first-principles framework, based on existing open-source codes, that can be used to model these systems. This framework is then used to evaluate the exciton binding energies and superfluid properties of hundreds of different heterostructures. Based on these calculations, the authors propose optimized materials with superior properties compared to the standard platforms.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 014506] Published Thu Jul 20, 2023",

Here, the authors reveal that the isotope 121,123Sb nuclei with large quadrupole moments are a sensitive local probe to observe the dynamics of orbital degrees of freedom.

Here, the authors comprehensively study these nonreciprocal optical effects resonantly enhanced by electromagnons for multiferroic spin spiral states of perovskite manganites. The giant nonreciprocity observed near the phase boundary demonstrates an important role of anharmonicity of spin excitations for these nonreciprocal effects.

The idea of symmetry has become intrinsically linked with topology described and algebraically characterized by higher categories. Studying three-dimensional systems with noninvertible symmetries, the authors show here that these symmetries are in general incompatible with a unique gapped ground state. Their results extend the ideas behind the Lieb-Shultz-Mattis theorem to the arena of higher-dimensional field theories invariant under a novel class of symmetries.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Finley\nThe spin-valley physics of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) remains one of the main interests in the class of van der Waals materials. At low temperature, it is mainly driven by the electron-hole exchange interaction (EHEI) that describes the annihilation of an exciton in one valley and the creation of an exciton in the time-reversal equivalent valley. Here, the authors show that the EHEI in monolayer TMDs is biaxial strain dependent and, surprisingly, it is an order of magnitude more strain dependent than expected from these first principles calculations. This points to a valley scattering channel that has not been considered in the literature so far.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, L041404] Published Thu Jul 20, 2023",

The fractional charge was confirmed almost thirty years ago, while the fractional statistics was observed only a few years back. In this paper, the authors focus on yet another fundamental property of the anyons, namely their spin. They derive a “spin-statistics relation” for anyons in fractional quantum Hall states, directly from the microscopic theory. This relation is a generalization of the fundamental “spin-statistics relation” that all ordinary particles obey.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, L041105] Published Tue Jul 18, 2023",

Here quantum systems—in particular the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond—show a path forward, as they can be laser-cooled to a quantum mechanical ground state while a device remains at ambient conditions. By placing an ensemble of N-V centers inside a low-loss microwave cavity in which their spins strongly interact with gigahertz magnetic fields, the cold spins extract more energy than can leak in from the hot environment. The output voltage shows vastly reduced fluctuations at the cavity frequency; the effective temperature is lowered by 150 K.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 20, 014033] Published Mon Jul 17, 2023",

By combining a high-finesse microcavity with an ultrasensitive force sensor (a suspended SiC nanowire), one can reach the regime where a single photon in the cavity has a measurable impact on the nanoresonator. The internal optical resonances of the nanowire strongly structure and possibly enhance the light-nanowire interaction, which can be fine-tuned through careful positioning of the subwavelength-sized nanowire within the standing wave inside the cavity.\n\n[Phys.

In this study, the authors rationalize the antiferroelectric Pbam state of PbZrO3 as a modulated phase, where polarization and antiphase O6 octahedra tilts are coupled via a trilinear gradient term – the so-called rotopolar coupling. A Landau-like continuum Hamiltonian, with gradient terms calculated directly from first principles, gives an accurate description of the energetics and structure of the Pbam phase. Besides reconciling the existing theories on PbZrO3, this study may facilitate the understanding of other modulated structures in perovskites, including ferrielectric and incommensurate phases.\n\n[Phys.

The work demonstrates how to use the measured values to extract the piezoelectric coefficient d33 for a generic thin-film system by means of finite-element modeling. Finally, the work shows how to assess the electromechanical figure of merit for thin films, and offers a procedure for how to compare them to their bulk counterparts via the electromechanical coupling coefficient k33.\n\n[Phys.

This length-scale reduction offers an opportunity to achieve higher density of quantum information storage, and may open a path to scalable implementations of superconducting quantum processors. However, the smallness of the acoustic wavelength also poses a challenge: It may result in fast qubit decoherence via an unintentional emission of phonons.

This study discusses the classical analogue of the well-known second-quantization formalism, and uses it to analyze a dimerized mechanical chain. The formalism reveals a striking resemblance between the Hamiltonians of the classical dimerized chain and the Kitaev chain, a toy model renowned for bound-state solutions akin to Majorana zero modes. This formulation provides a powerful tool to discover and design classical mechanical mimics of topological quantum systems.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 20, 014019] Published Tue Jul 11, 2023",

The design of high-performance antiferromagnet-based memory and logic devices has been limited by a lack of knowledge about the interaction of AFM solitons with grain boundaries. The authors develop a model of a nanocrystalline AFM material (e.g. magnetoelectric Cr2O3), including proper intergrain exchange. Their approach provides design rules for granular AFM memory devices, and should stimulate further research on ultrafast magnetization dynamics of the order parameter in insulating granular AFM thin films.\n\n[Phys.

          "description": "Author(s): Jordan Cotler and Semon Rezchikov\nThis highly original paper relates the exact renormalization group (ERG) flow to optimal gradient flow which naturally leads to the (previously known) interpretation of the ERG as a flow that minimizes the relative entropy of a probability distribution. This provides an elegant explanation of otherwise opaque features of ERG schemes and establishes a clear and intriguing link to information theory. The intuitive picture that emerges is that the coarse-graining of the RG flow produces entropy and this entropy production determines the flow itself. All these basic relations are established nonperturbatively.\n\n[Phys. Rev. D 108, 025003] Published Wed Jul 05, 2023",

Here, the authors mix two antiferromagnets, namely MnTiO3 and NiTiO3, to form Ni0.25Mn0.75TiO3. The parent magnets are of competing anisotropy. The former has an easy magnetic axis along the c axis, whereas the latter has an easy magnetic plane within the ab plane. The authors also shed light on the doping effect upon the long-range magnetic order, emergent magnetic phases, and the magnetic entropy consumption in comparison to the parent magnets. Finally, they employ different thermodynamic probes to build a complex and rich anisotropic magnetic phase diagram of Ni0.25Mn0.75TiO3.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 014406] Published Wed Jul 05, 2023",

The advent of topological materials raises a largely unexplored question: how are VR equations and their solutions modified when electronic bands are topological? Here, the authors solve VR equations analytically in a Weyl semimetal placed under a magnetic field and subjected to a spatially inhomogeneous light pulse. They predict photoinduced plasma oscillations, which originate from a topological term in VR equations.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 024301] Published Wed Jul 05, 2023",

However, studying the order parameter is challenging because some established experimental techniques are not compatible with diamond anvil pressure cells. Here, the authors show that ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy is an efficient method to accomplish this task. Using this approach, they succeed in mapping the spin density wave order parameter in iron-based superconductor BaFe2As2 over a broad range of pressures and temperatures.\n\n[Phys. Rev.
