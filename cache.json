The hydrodynamic interactions among bubbles in a chain determine its stability. The wake behind each bubble affects the subsequent ones, producing a lift force. For a clean and small bubble, the lift force is destabilizing; when surfactants are present or the bubble size exceeds a certain value, the additional vorticity production on the surface changes the structure of the wake and the sign of the lift force is reversed resulting in a stable chain.\n\n[Phys.

One question that arises is, when are the 4D SCFTs obtained from distinct constructions isomorphic? The authors show in great detail and with a large class of examples that this happens when there exists a “parent” N=(1,0) 6D SCFT.

Thus little is known about nonequilibrium ODOS properties, although they are important in e.g. solar cells and LEDs. This work presents an optical technique for monitoring the ODOS distribution of relaxed charge carriers at low temperatures. The distribution that forms under nonequilibrium conditions is always narrower than that of the full DOS, in a universal ratio of about 2/3 that is reproduced by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations assuming spatially correlated disorder.\n\n[Phys.

They demonstrate that the scale-free localization is a generic phenomenon, regardless of the parity-time symmetry, the eigenstates’ coalescence, or even the incommensurate disorder. The results also indicate that the bulk properties of the original Hermitian systems can be globally reshaped by local non-Hermiticity.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 107, 134121] Published Fri Apr 28, 2023",

They find a high-energy spectrum consistent with reports of a spinon Fermi surface state in triangular lattice compounds, although the low-energy spectrum rules out such a phase, and points towards a U(1) Dirac spin liquid.

However, high-fidelity operation demands good spectral addressability and noncontextual spin dynamics. The authors explore an unexpected crosstalk mechanism, in which the Rabi frequency of one spin changes markedly depending on the simultaneous operation of another. They also connect this behavior to another surprising feature: the nonlinear scaling of Rabi frequency with resonant driving amplitude. These results provide insight into the challenges that such state-of-the-art control methods will face.\n\n[Phys. Rev. Applied 19, 044078] Published Tue Apr 25, 2023",

In principle, a single photon can carry much information in its spatiotemporal modes; the challenge is to read it out, as linear optical elements are not sensitive to the subtle differences among those modes. This study demonstrates a nonlinear-optical approach in which a single pass through a LiNiO3 waveguide can separate photons according to their detailed spatiotemporal profiles or their superpositions, even if they completely overlap with each other. This provides access to photons’ large Hilbert spaces, pointing to applications in free-space quantum communication, computing, and sensing.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

Unfortunately, Coulomb repulsion between ions can significantly deteriorate CABIS performance. The authors demonstrate that embedded Rydberg atoms can be used for noninvasive, near-real-time measurement of the electric fields between ions in CABIS, and thereby to control Coulomb-induced degradation via feedback. The spectra of different Rydberg states reveal which states are suitable for low- and high-field monitoring, and this work also sheds light on many-body interactions between ultracold ions and neutral atoms.\n\n[Phys.

In nuclear density functional theory (DFT), the description of fissioning systems with an odd number of particles is markedly more involved, both formally and computationally. This article combines coupled-channels reaction theory, which provides the spin distribution of the fissioning system, and nuclear DFT, which describes the collective dynamics of fission, to predict the charge and mass distribution of fission fragments of odd-mass uranium isotopes. The new methodology offers a path forward to properly account for the entrance channel in the description of fission observables.\n\n[Phys. Rev. C 107, 044312] Published Mon Apr 17, 2023",

Within a Kohn-Luttinger-like approach, the internal screening of the long-range Coulomb potential leads to an effective attraction between carriers, enabling the formation of Cooper pairs. The calculations provide a filling-dependent critical temperature that is remarkably enhanced due to Ising spin-orbit coupling, and determine the spin-triplet valley-singlet symmetry of the superconducting order parameter, in line with recent experimental advances.\n\n[Phys.

Temperature gradients at the laser spot directly yield skyrmion motion, due to temperature dependence of magnetic parameters, but another contribution can be even more important: Thermoelastic lattice expansion results in a strain-induced local gradient in magnetic anisotropy. This method of skyrmion displacement allows full control of motion over a magnetic surface, with a possible path to MEMS-VCSEL on-chip integration.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

In the disordered superconductors studied here, a starkly different scenario unfolds: Josephson vortices with insulating cores nucleate, long-range phase coherence of the superconductor and its energy-gap vanish at different critical fields, opening up a pseudogap region of Cooper-paired insulator.

The authors of this study demonstrate the potential of an amorphous material to become an exciton condensate, in which energy can flow with minimal frictional loss. Unlike the Bechgaard salts that support superconductivity only at high pressures, the authors show that the amorphous polymer NiTTFtt, recently synthesized by Xie and Anderson, exhibits the computational signature of exciton condensation at atmospheric pressure and its synthetic geometry. This research supports the realistic possibility of harnessing chemical tunability to achieve “strongly correlated” phenomena at more ambient conditions, opening novel avenues for superefficient energy transfer in technologically relevant materials.\n\n[Phys.

The authors of the present study investigate the potential of starburst galaxies (SBGs) - so named for being particularly active environments for formation of new stars - to be the sources of UHECRs. Using Monte Carlo simulations of the extremely dense and turbulent environment in the most active region of SBGs, the authors show by a highly suggestive comparison to data obtained by the Pierre Auger Observatory that SBGs can be sources of UHECRs.\n\n[Phys.

QRPA calculations using a nuclear compression modulus that reproduces the position of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance in 208Pb predict too high an energy for the same excitation in the Sn isotopes. The author shows that the self-consistent inclusion of quasiparticle-vibration coupling beyond QRPA in a relativistic framework can solve the problem. This indicates that a consensus between a softer equation of state extracted from the compressibility of finite nuclei and a stiffer one required by recent analyses of neutron star data can be achieved by systematic incorporation of beyond-QRPA many-body correlations in the theory.\n\n[Phys.

Pfeiffer\nInside solids, photons can become strongly interacting, which allows the possibility of optical transistors, in a which one light beam controls the transmission of another light beam. The strength of this interaction can be greatly increased in specially designed structures in which the photon frequency is near an electronic resonance known as an exciton. The exact value of this interaction strength has been much debated, ranging over orders of magnitude. This paper reviews a set of experiments and argues for a number well below some earlier estimates, but still large compared to the predictions of standard theory calculations.\n\n[Phys. Rev.

The authors merge the idea of STM tip-induced deformation to probe in situ the gradual nanoscale structural changes on moiré patterns with strain. They show the first experimental proof that one-dimensional domain walls of moiré patterns can laterally split into two similar to the triangular networks of one-dimensional electronic channels in domain walls, topologically protected around AA nodes. Further, domain-wall edge states are also possibly probed with spectroscopy.\n\n[Phys. Rev. B 107, L161402] Published Wed Apr 05, 2023",

However, the impact of cold-atom sensors in real-world applications has been limited by the overall laser cooling package. This study amalgamates a chip-scale optics setup with a microfabricated laser cooling system to dramatically reduce device size, weight, and power usage. The authors use an on-chip Zeeman offset lock for laser cooling, and demonstrate improved atom number afforded by new techniques in silicon cell fabrication. The simplicity, scalability, and utility demonstrated in this cold-atom platform will enable exciting opportunities in portable cold-atom clocks and interferometers.\n\n[Phys. Rev.
